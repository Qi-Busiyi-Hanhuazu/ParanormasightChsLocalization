In truth, Yoko is a descendant of onmyoji who continue to practice in modern times. Her ancestor, [c4]Ashino[c0], attempted to steal the Rite of Resurrection in Honjo during the Edo period.
Born with exceptional spirit sense, Yoko learned about her own ancestry while researching her roots, and was disappointed to find her bloodline had fallen into mediocrity. She became consumed with the ambition to restore her family's lost glory through her own powers, and devised a scheme to succeed where Ashino failed and perform the Rite of Resurrection.
Yoko continued her training, developing her spiritual and curse powers until she discovered the Record of Fates, which offered clues regarding the Rite. She plotted to use the curses of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo to gather a large number of soul dregs by calling forth curse echoes and setting the stage for mutual slaughter. The ultimate plan involved invoking a large-scale Feast of Shadows, awakening the curses, performing the Rite herself, and bringing together enough soul dregs to revive Ashino.
Since the effects of the curses increase the more people know and fear them, she first entrusted the Record of Fates to local historian Hideki Araishi, who could be used to easily spread the rumors. She also contacted [c4]Fumichika Nejima[c0], a criminal with a deep understanding of mystic arts, to obtain the curse stones needed to gather soul dregs. Unsurprisingly, Nejima was very interested in the story of Ashino, and readily agreed to aid his revival.
While carrying out these steps, Yuko learned of the existence of the Yin Scroll, which threatened to thwart her plans. She added a note about the scroll in the Record of Fates before giving it to Araishi, intending to acquire it before it could pose an issue.
Through her investigations, Yoko discovered that [c4]Hajime Yoshimi[c0] was a descendant of Seiman, and threatened him with a curse in an effort to scare him into revealing the whereabouts of the Yin Scroll. While Hajime bravely resisted Yoko's threats, she killed him with the curse to ensure Seiman's descendant would not stand in her way.
As her preparations were coming together, Yoko obtained the seemingly less dangerous curse stone of the Whispering Canal in order to become a curse bearer—a necessity for gathering the curse stones for the Feast of Shadows. Shogo Okiie, also a descendant of Seiman, was eyed as a potential risk factor, and contacted to ensure he would be located nearby and subject to monitoring. However, unaware that the spirit of Seiman would be awakened within Shogo as soon as she invoked the curse, Yoko's plan was thwarted when she was immediately cursed to death by Seiman.","CHR02_ST_0006","False","","",""

The Shigima family came from a line of samurai who built their residence in Honjo during the Edo period. They assumed important positions in the police force following the Meiji Revolution, thereby protecting their family's elevated status. Even today, many in the Shigima line work as police bureaucrats and senior police officers. Harue's father sits in the upper echelons of the National Police Agency, and her husband, adopted into the Shigima clan through an arranged marriage, is also a highly respected Agency official.
However, as her family prioritizes work above all else, it wasn't long before Harue's marriage grew cold. Though she wants for nothing, she is isolated from her neighbors and withdrawn from society. Seeing her son grow into a young man gave Harue a purpose in life, but it was cut short by the kidnapping incident.
Following the incident, Harue spent many days in a deep depression, breaking into sudden fits of shouting and wandering around in the middle of the night. Her cheerful, loving disposition faded away, and she took to making snide remarks at her husband, which only further soured their relationship.
A few months ago, Harue's husband was transferred to another area for work and now rarely returns home, with Harue left to live in the large, empty mansion alone.

Once a police officer, Richter was wracked with guilt over the police's inability to help all those in need, and quit the force to start his own private investigation firm. However, his softhearted nature leads him to take on too many cases and has put his office in dire financial straits. How he is still in business is a mystery, with some whispering that a wealthy patron is keeping him afloat.
Richter studied alongside detective [c4]Jun Erio[c0] at the police academy.
Somewhat surprisingly—given his outlandish clothing and mannerisms—Richter excels at covert investigations and tailing his targets. He proudly refers to himself as an investigator extraordinaire, though that only ever succeeds at impressing himself.
Richter's biggest source of happiness is nuzzling his pet female albino parakeet—Ernestine—which he keeps in his office. He also enjoys collecting Mocking Bird stickers, a popular line of merchandise featuring birds inexplicably dressed like delinquents, and can be frequently sighted searching around town for them.
While out and about, Richter typically leaves the office (and, more importantly, Ernestine) in the care of Amamori, a junior high schooler who volunteered to assist Richter after being involved in a previous case.","CHR04_ST_0007","False","","",""

Rather than sitting behind a desk, Chief Inspector Tsutsumi always worked in the field as he moved his way up the police force. Behind his stern face lies a compassionate man ever prepared to help his fellow officers. That same attentiveness to his work and colleagues, however, cost Tetsuo his marriage several years ago.
Tetsuo has a penchant for candy and desserts, which he tries (but fails) to conceal from other officers at the risk of appearing soft. He delights in buying local sweets wherever he is sent to investigate a case and would often volunteer to be dispatched to distant locations to acquire them while he was with the Paranormal Affairs Bureau. He is also surprisingly knowledgeable about current trends, a trait he puts down to investigation-related research, but which is actually spurred by his wish to have something to discuss with his daughter.","CHR05_ST_0007","False","","",""

Born to a relatively well-off household, Jun developed a healthy sense of self-esteem and an optimistic outlook on life. Although watching action movies and detective series as a child instilled in him a desire to help those in need, it was the sight of Tetsuo Tsutsumi—who was in charge of investigating a case Jun was involved in as a student—that truly inspired him to become a police officer. While Jun still maintains a strong respect for Tetsuo, he also gets much enjoyment out of making casual cracks to get a rise out of the veteran officer.

He attended the police academy with [c4]Richter Kai[c0], who is now a private investigator.

そんな頃《根島事件》が発生し 大々的に報道されているのを見て たったひとりの男が たったひとつの犯行で 世の《良識》を真っ向から否定し 気取った社会に大きな亀裂を入れたことに 衝撃を受ける。以後 根島史周に関する情報はすべて収集し 自分の中に理想像を築き上げては 憧れを募らせていった。 
その後 悪徳商法によって検挙され その服役中に根島史周本人と出会い より一層 傾倒していった。根島の寄る辺が魔術への信奉だったことを知ると 完全に心酔していた彼は 出所後 根島が隠していた魔道書と その思想を受け継いだ。
白石稔子については ある日 パートタイムで働く彼女の容貌を気に入り 狙いを定める。家長を失った白石家が金に困って 娘の進学もままならないということを知ると 金をチラつかせ 弱みにつけ込み 甘い言葉で取り入っていった。内縁の関係になってからは豹変し 完全に金と暴力で 母娘を支配した。魔術への信奉もより強くなり ヒハクというスポンサーを得て 白石家に様々な儀式を強制するようになった。反抗したら すぐに暴力を振るって黙らせた。大人しい性格だった母娘は何も言えずに 従うばかりだった。
そんな中 ヒハクから 金のために魔術の完成を急かされた岩井は 幼子を生け贄とする《若返りの黒魔術》に手を出す。その生け贄の対象には 根島史周が恨んでいた志岐間春恵の息子を選ぶ。少年の誘拐は 警戒させないため白石美智代に手伝わせた。なかなか言うことをきかなかったため このときは母親の稔子を20発殴ることで従わせた。美智代の協力で誘拐した少年は 白石家に監禁した。暴れたり逃げたりしそうだったので 美智代に身の回りの面倒をみさせた上で 逃げたら美智代を殺すと脅したら 正義感の強い少年は無抵抗になった。この誘拐は 警察への私怨もあったが なにより秩序の否定を示すため 身代金を要求して誘拐事件とし 騒ぎを起こそうとした。しかし 報道規制されたために 根島事件のように 世間に対する大きな波は起こらなかった。
イラついた岩井は 生け贄の儀式を稔子に行わせた。やらなければ美智代を殺すと脅したら 少年が寝ているうちに実行した。しかし生け贄を捧げても 魔術は発動しなかった。岩井は儀式の失敗を稔子のせいにして なじった。

それ以後 白石母娘は 罪を負った懺悔を 誰にも言えずに抱えて過ごすことになる。岩井は 生け贄こそ行わなくなったが魔術への傾倒は強まるばかりで 白石母娘は 金と暴力によってその協力を強いられる日々を 続けることとなった。","
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
Kankichiro once made a living by placing advertisements in magazines to sell phony magic items and good luck charms. He held a nostalgic yearning for the postwar era when things and people were simple, and has nothing but negative things to say about the rapidly developing, ostentatious world of late. Radical in his belief that it would be better to tear down society and start over again, Kankichiro was discontent with his life spent poking around in society's cesspools to make a few coins.
When the Nejima Murders were widely reported in the media, it had a great impact on Kankichiro, as he witnessed how a single act by a single man could cause a major rift in society. Perceiving Fumichika Nejima as a great hero, he began collecting every piece of information he could find on the man.
Kankichiro was later arrested for his illegal business practices, and a chance meeting with Fumichika during his incarceration solidified his idolization. He was captivated by Fumichika's talk of black magic, and, following his release, acquired the grimoire Fumichika had hidden away.
As for Toshiko Shiraishi, Kankichiro set his sights on her after encountering her at her part-time job. When he learned that the Shiraishi family was in financial trouble and could not afford to send Michiyo to college, he turned on the charm and took advantage of their weakness by offering them money. He revealed his true colors, however, after moving in with the family, and used violence and money to keep Toshiko and Michiyo under his thumb. All the while, his belief in black magic deepened, and he found a sponsor in the Hihaku corporation. Kankichiro forced the Shiraishi family to perform various rituals, with any attempts to resist being met with merciless beatings. The mother and daughter were helpless to resist.
After Hihaku offered Kankichiro great sums to intensify his work with black magic, he set his mind to sacrificing a child in order to perform a youth restoration spell. For this purpose, he chose Shuichi Shigima—the son of Harue Shigima, against whom Fumichika held a grudge. He attempted to enlist Michiyo so as not to alarm the boy, and when she resisted, beat her mother twenty times. With Michiyo's assistance, Kankichiro kidnapped Shuichi and locked him up in the Shiraishi house, and told the young and courageous boy that he'd kill Michiyo if he tried to run.
While his actions were motivated by a personal grudge against the police, it was first and foremost an attempt to create a societal uproar and breakdown in public order—so Kankichiro painted the crime as a regular kidnapping, demanding a ransom from the family. However, because of an embargo on the press, the kidnapping did not cause a public outcry akin to that of the Nejima Murders. Infuriated, Kankichiro had Toshiko perform the sacrifice ritual by threatening to kill Michiyo if she refused. Toshiko killed Shuichi in his sleep, but the spell failed, for which Kankichiro blamed her.
Warning Michiyo to keep silent about the murder to avoid incriminating her mother, Kankichiro dumped the boy's body in a nearby river. The tiny corpse was found a week later in the Sumida River after floating through several canals in Honjo. Having drifted for days in the polluted waters, little evidence remained.
Although Kankichiro performed no further sacrifices, his devotion to black magic only increased. Toshiko and Michiyo spent their days consumed by guilt, forced to continue serving Kankichiro until the day they died.","CHR20_ST_0006","False","","",""

Shuichi was a conscientious, brave young boy who was determined to protect his mother, Harue, amid his father's frequent absences. He dreamed of becoming a police officer and displayed diligence and an impressive sense of responsibility from a young age, likely due to being raised in an extremely strict environment.
Born in the early 70s, he spent his days immersed in various activities and studies, including playing piano, learning the abacus, taking English lessons, and training in kendo.
Shuichi's tendency to put other people's needs over his own meant he died without ever telling his classmates how much he longed for them all to go out on a hunt for Mocking Bird stickers.","CHR21_ST_0006","False","","",""

第二次大戦時は 10代後半で志願兵として出征し 部隊で自分だけが捕虜となり生き残った経験から 奇跡を信じるようになる。終戦を迎え 解放される頃には 捕虜生活の中である程度の英語を覚え また与えられた食事のせいで出兵時よりも肥えていた。
帰国すると 都内にあった実家の周辺は焼け野原となっており 親兄弟すべて被災して亡くなっていた。財産は何もなく 身ひとつの状態からコツコツと仕事を重ねていって やがて隅田川の近くで小さな雑貨商を営むようになる。繁盛するほどではなかったが 自分ひとりならどうにか食っていけた。
焼け野原から復興していく東京を目の当たりにしながら どんどん新しい文化が入ってくることに刺激を受けていた。特に本が好きで 店の定休日には神田の古書肆を巡り 珍しい海外の本を探すことが趣味だった。特に超常現象などオカルト的なものが 彼の心に刺さった。戦争で奇跡的に生きて帰った経験から 人智を超えた超常的なチカラは存在すると信じて疑っていなかった。西洋黒魔術についても 最初は数ある興味のひとつくらいの気持ちであったが 資料を集めていくうちに どんどんその神秘的な魅力に取り憑かれていった。
30を過ぎても独り身であった彼は 魔術によって伴侶を召喚するという儀式を行ってみた。すると間もなくして [c4]篠[c0]と名乗る女性と知り合った。本名はわからない。地方の故郷で暮らしていけなくなって抜け出したものの 行くアテもなく 僅かな日銭を稼ぎながらどうにか東京までやってきたらしく 出会ったときはボロボロのみすぼらしい様相で 飢え死に寸前の状態だった。魔術の件もあり縁を感じた根島は 彼女を自宅に迎え入れ 住まわせることにした。篠とは 天涯孤独同士で馬が合った。篠は 少しずつ回復していったが もともと身体が丈夫ではなく 働きに出ることは難しかった。根島は それほど商売上手ではなく 金銭的に不自由のない暮らしとは ほど遠かったが それでも篠は 戦時中に比べれば 毎日飯が食えるだけで幸せだと言い 私はあんたと少しでも一緒にいられればいいと 優しく笑いかけるのだった。根島と篠は お互いを支え合って ささやかで慎ましく そしてかけがえのない時間を過ごしていく。
ところが数年後 ある出来事をきっかけに篠の容態が悪化。町医者に診せても対処できない状態で しかし大きな病院に連れていくだけの金はなく 治癒の魔術などに頼ってもみたが回復することはなく 篠はそのまま 成す術なく自宅の寝床で「先に すまないね。あと頼むよ」とだけ言い残し静かに事切れた。
根島は 激しい絶望に明け暮れた。
このときに気分を紛らわせるため 酒や食べ物を片っ端から摂ったせいで 急激に肥えた。
しばらくしてようやく町を歩けるようになった頃 ふと目を向けた露店の古書肆で 見たことのない魔道書を発見した。その魔道書には 《蘇生の黒魔術》の詳しいやり方が載っていた。若い女性を解体して生け贄に捧げる必要があるが 今までやってきた術とは違い そこまで代償が大きい術ならば必ず効果があるに違いないと思った。根島は この魔道書の黒魔術を心の拠り所とし これまで以上に強く傾倒していった。
そして 町で 行き倒れ寸前の女性を探して 地下倉庫に連れてくると 魔道書の通りに 生け贄を捧げる儀式を敢行した。
１回目は 特に効果は出なかった。
工程にためらいがあったのがいけなかったのだと思い もう一度 できるだけ手早くやってみた。でもやはりだめだった。同じように 合計で４回行った。いずれも使い終わった遺体は さらに細かく解体して 汚染された隅田川に棄てたが それで見つかることはなかった。しかし４回目の儀式でも特に効果が現れず 失意のまま後片付けをしているとき……かたわらにいる 痩せ細った赤ん坊に気がついた。そして根島は ひとこと つぶやいた。

Fumichika first began believing in miracles when he voluntarily enlisted in World War II as a teenager and was the only POW in his unit to survive. By the time the war ended and he was freed, he had learned some English and gained considerable weight from the food he was given in captivity.
Upon returning to Japan, Fumichika found that the area in which his parents' house was located in Tokyo had been burned to the ground, and his entire family wiped out in the disaster. Starting over from nothing, he worked hard and eventually opened a small general store near the Sumida River. Though it was not a thriving business, it was enough to put food on the table.
Fumichika was inspired by the new cultural trends flooding into the city as Tokyo was rebuilt from the ashes. He was especially fond of books, and enjoyed visiting antique bookstores in Kanda to search for rare foreign books in his free time. Of all books, however, it was those on the paranormal and the occult that caught his eye, as he was already open to the existence of such things due to his miraculous return from the war. What was initially a passing interest gradually became a deep fascination with Western black magic as he gathered more information on the subject.
Still single after 30, Fumichika tried performing a black magic ritual to summon a partner. Soon after, he met a woman who called herself [c4]Shino[c0], though her real name remains unknown. Shino had left her hometown in the countryside where she had no family or work to support her, and somehow made it to Tokyo while earning a meager daily wage. When she met Fumichika, she was haggard and on the verge of starvation. Fumichika, who felt a connection with Shino due to the ritual, decided to take her into his home and let her live there. Both of them having lived alone for most of their lives, the two turned out to be a perfect match.
Shino gradually recovered, but still was not strong enough to work. Fumichika was by no means a skilled businessman, and their lives were far from financially secure, but Shino, who had experienced wartime Japan, was simply content to have food on the table to eat every day. The two spent their days together, poor but happy to be by each other's sides.
Several years later, Shino's condition took a severe turn for the worse. The local doctor could offer them no help and, without enough money to take Shino to a major hospital, Fumichika resorted to using black magic to heal her. However, it was of no use, and she passed away at their home. Her final words were: ""I'm sorry I must go first. I'll leave the rest to you.""
Fumichika plunged into intense despair. He drank and ate everything he could to distract himself, which caused him to rapidly gain weight. After a while, when he was finally able to walk around town once more, he found himself drawn to an antique bookstore, within which he found a grimoire he had never laid eyes on before. The grimoire contained detailed instructions on how to perform a resurrection through black magic. The rite required the dismemberment and sacrifice of a young woman, but this great cost only served to convince Fumichika that this would be the spell that would finally work. He embraced the grimoire and let its depictions of black magic consume his heart more than ever before.
Fumichika then found a destitute woman in town who was on the verge of collapse, brought her to a basement warehouse, and performed the ritual sacrifice. However, it had no effect. Thinking that his own hesitation had got in the way, he was swift to perform the ritual again, but it still proved fruitless. He repeated this process four times in total. Each time, he dismembered the body into small pieces and dumped them into the filthy Sumida River, where they were never found. While cleaning up after his fourth kill, a disappointed Fumichika noticed an emaciated baby nearby.

With their wicker baskets on their backs, they would leave for the canal every morning and fish till the evening. The miso soup her mother Koma made using the carp they caught was to die for. Her parents loved her dearly.
One day, however, her father disappeared. Toki's mother went to look for him and never came back either. Those who came to express their concern eventually stopped visiting her out of fear. Toki continued to wait, all alone.
""Mother, Father, where did you go? Don't leave me behind...""
Unable to bear the loneliness, she left her home and trudged along the roads until night fell. Neither her mother nor father were anywhere to be found. Tears stung her eyes.
Suddenly, the sound of fish splashing in the water cut through the silence. She found herself standing before the canal where they used to fish together. The taste of carp and the memory of her father's smile flashed across her mind. Without thinking, Toki walked into the moat. The sound of water splashing echoed throughout the night air. Passersby thought of it only as the fish in the canal.
The splashing faded, and silence returned to the lonely night.","DOC05_ST_0009","False","","",""

The light of the man's life begins to fade as regret and anger wash over him in turns.

The man who tricked the people with his false dark arts swings from a rope. They'd thought the man had escaped the previous night, but oddly enough, he was found hanging in the garden of the daimyo's mansion that morning.
The man, a local named Jinkichi, was known for his kind temperament and skill in crafting netsuke clasps. While his life wasn't always easy, he was optimistic, the type to smile through whatever life threw at him. He was the kind of man who would take care of those who didn't have anyone else to rely on.
The prosperity that the ukiyo-e boom brought must have been what fanned the flames of his greed.
The old craftsman was found in a miserable state, as if sentenced to some cruel fate. Perhaps he'd ended his own life, unable to bear the weight of his crime. But dead men tell no tales, and the people thought of him as a bad man even in death.
He hung there for days, till his neck stretched horrifically, a visage of pain still etched on his face. It was clear he must've struggled greatly as he died, his flesh marked with dark scars where the rope wrapped around his whole body.

江戸時代後期のこと。本所の長屋で暮らす一家がいた。
根付職人の[c4]甚吉[c0] その妻の[c4]コマ[c0]と娘の[c4]トキ[c0]。貧しいながらも
真面目に明るく暮らしていた一家は ある日 行き倒れの男を拾う。
男は 京からきた声聞師で [c4][%6][c0]と名乗った。
何者かから逃げ 命からがら ここまで辿り着いたが ついに
身体を壊し 手持ちの銭も尽きてしまったとのこと。
甚吉は そんな彼を放っておけず 匿うことにした。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
甚吉一家の親身な世話により一命を取りとめた男は 出立の際に
「礼をしたいが 生憎 金銭に換えられるような物は何もない」と
前置きした上で「誰か蘇らせたい者は いるか？」と尋ねる。
実は 彼は本名を [c4]土御門晴曼[c0]といい 正統な陰陽師の血族であり
幻だった《蘇りの秘術》を研究していた男だった。禁忌の秘術を
復活させた罪で 一族から追放されることになったが 逃亡中に
その術式のすべてを『禄命簿』と名付けた書に記したのだという。
秘術の行使には 人を呪い殺し 滓魂を集める必要があるという。
あくまで 探求心から研究していただけの晴曼であったが
「甚吉一家のためなら 秘術を使っても良い」と考えていた。
しかし その途方もない話を聞いた甚吉はかぶりを振る。
「誰かを犠牲にするなんて とんでもねえ。俺たちは 見返りを
求めて助けたわけじゃねえんだから 礼なんて気にするな」と。
そうして晴曼は 何度も頭を下げながら 長屋を去っていった。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
さて 長屋には売れない浮世絵師の[c4]千斎翁[c0]が住んでおり 甚吉と
コマが仕事に出ている間は トキがよく世話になっていた。
幼いトキは 晴曼が語った《蘇りの秘術》の話を聞いてはいたが
理解はしておらず 物語として千斎翁に教えてあげていた。
千斎翁はその話に感化されて筆を執ると 一心不乱に
一枚の浮世絵を描き上げる。蘇りを題材としたその絵の評判は
たちまちに 町に広がった。商魂たくましい甚吉は その話に乗り
浮世絵と関連する根付を作って 蘇りにまつわる小噺やら
御利益やらを創り上げて売りさばき おおいに繁盛したのだった。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
「あの男も いい置き土産をしてくれたねぇ」と喜ぶ甚吉一家だが
それが悲劇を招くことになるとは 思いもよらなかった。やがて
評判が地元の大名の下まで届き 藩邸に召し出される千斎翁。
だが そこで待っていたのは 凄惨な仕打ちであった。
千斎翁を嬲るその女こそ 晴曼を追っていた陰陽師 [c4]蘆乃[c0]であった。
晴曼が《蘇りの秘術》を研究するように唆した当人であり
己の美貌を永遠に保つために 秘術を用いようと企んでいた。
蘆乃は 家族を亡くしたばかりの大名の心の弱みに付け込み
思うがままに操ると 蘇りの噂の出元である千斎翁を捕えさせた。
「蘇りの秘術の話をどこで聞いたか 吐くがいい」と詰めながら
激しい殴打を繰り返すその音は 太鼓の如く鳴り渡り 火の見櫓の
ある津軽家上屋敷にまで 夜な夜な不気味に響いたという……。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
蘆乃は拷問の末に 甚吉一家や『禄命簿』の存在について知る。
大名に命じられた[c4]家老[c0]は 甚吉を引っ立てると 拷問を続けた。
晴曼の居場所や『禄命簿』の在処を 吐かせるためだった。
晴曼の行方は知らぬ甚吉であったが 知っていても絶対教えぬと
頑なに口を閉ざしたまま ついには命を落としてしまう。大名は
「蘇りという偽りの噂を流し 民衆を惑わせた罪に耐えきれず
自死した」として 甚吉の亡骸を椎の木に吊させた。
蘇りの秘術の噂が民衆に広まると それを狙う者が増えて
動きにくくなるとして 蘆乃が仕向けさせたことであった。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
甚吉の件が広まると 秘術は妄言であったのかと人々は興を失う。
しかし家老の工作を目撃していた[c4]踊子[c0]が 触れ回ったことで
本所は騒然となる。家老は 噂を留めるために娘を捕え 取引を
持ち掛けた。栄誉に目がくらみ 作り話であったと吹聴して回る娘。
そうして こしらえてもらった舞台に立ったが 口封じのため
膠の塗られたお面を付けられ まんまと殺されてしまった。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
コマは 夫の甚吉が首を縊るなど 端から信じていなかった。
誰かの仕業に違いないと 大名家に関係する者の 名前や住処などの
詳しい情報をしつこく嗅ぎ回り ひとりひとりあたっていった。
これ以上 事を荒立たせるわけにはいかぬと 家老は
間諜を務めていた浪人の[c4]留蔵[c0]を雇い コマを狙わせる。
ところが「あんたがやったんじゃないのかい！」と逆に詰め寄られ
さんざ挑発された留蔵は逆上し 白昼堂々コマを斬り捨ててしまう。
その責を取るため 切腹を命じられた留蔵は 暗号に使っていた
蕎麦屋の行灯で 大名家の暗躍を訴えながら 腹を切った。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
こうして 両親が知らぬ間にいなくなり 置いていかれたトキは
深夜まで両親を探し歩いた末に 堀に落ちて 溺れ死んでしまう。
さらに いっこうに晴曼の居所がつかめず 苛立った蘆乃は
役立たずの家老の屋敷に火を放ち 焚殺する。
実は ここまでの関係者には 蘆乃によって呪いがかけられており
その死によって魂は 滓魂として集められていた。
あとは『禄命簿』さえあれば 秘術が使える状態だった。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
本所の異変にただならぬものを感じ 戻ってきた晴曼だが
時すでに遅く 恩人である甚吉一家の非業の死を知り 慟哭した。
滓魂が奪われていることで 蘆乃の仕業であると気づいた晴曼は
これ以上の犠牲を防ぐために いよいよ法恩寺橋にて対峙する。
夜明けまで続いた壮絶な法術合戦は 知らぬものには 不気味に
乱れ飛ぶ鬼火の瞬きに見えたという。
果てしのない戦いの末に 蘆乃は晴曼を倒し『禄命簿』を奪うが
その時すでに 自慢の足に呪いをかけられていた。
蘆乃は 呪いで穢れ 醜く爛れた足を引きずり 近くの旗本屋敷に
逃げ込むと「足を祓え！」と 怨嗟の声で喚き散らした。
蘆乃はそのまま 苦しみながら死んでいったが 深手を負った
晴曼もまた 無念の思いを抱えながら 法恩寺橋で息絶えた。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
しかし 死んだはずの晴曼は蘇った。万が一のためにと 対決前に
予め施しておいた術式に充分な滓魂が集まり秘術が発動したのだ。
晴曼は 自身の探求心が悲劇を引き起こした責任を感じるとともに
《蘇りの秘術》が なぜ禁忌の術として扱われていたのかを痛感し
この術は封印せねばならないと決意する。
蘇られるようにしておいたのも それを果たすためだった。
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
しかし 封じるべき『禄命簿』は すでに行方知れずとなっている。
そこで 甚吉の作った根付９つに 残った滓魂を籠めて法具とし
再び何者かが《蘇りの秘術》の術式を発動させようとしたときに
連動して発動する<u>仕掛け</u>を 本所の土地に封じ込めた。
そして このことを後世まで遺していくために すべての真相を
『禄命簿・陰の書』に記し 自らの末裔に伝えていくことにした。

[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
This is a story that takes place in the late Edo period.
There was once a family that lived in a row house in Honjo. The family consisted of a netsuke craftsman named [c4]Jinkichi[c0], his wife [c4]Koma[c0], and their daughter [c4]Toki[c0]. They enjoyed a poor but happy existence.
One day, they took in a man by the name of [c4][%6][c0], who claimed to be a shomoji. He was on the run, having barely escaped with his life from something or another, and wound up in Honjo. The tough circumstances had left him sick and destitute. Jinkichi felt sorry for the man and decided to shelter him.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
The stranger was deeply grateful for the kindness and care of Jinkichi's family, as without it he would've surely died, and told them thusly on the day of his departure, ""I want to give you my thanks, but unfortunately I have nothing of value."" He paused, then asked. ""Is there anyone you want to bring back to life?""
It turned out that the man's true name was Tsuchimikado Seiman, a descendant of renowned onmyoji, and he had been researching the fabled Rite of Resurrection. For his crime in unearthing this forbidden rite, he was chased out by his family, but he wrote down everything about the spell in a book he named the ""Record of Fates"" while on the run.
Whoever sought to perform the rite would need to kill people and gather their soul dregs. Seiman had only researched the rite out of the spirit of inquiry, but thought himself willing to use the rite if it was for the sake of Jinkichi's family.
However, Jinkichi shook his head. ""Sacrificing someone is unthinkable. We didn't help you because we wanted something in return, so you owe us nothing,"" he said, declining the unbelievable offer. Seiman bowed his head in gratitude countless times at those words and left their house.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
In the same area there lived an ukiyo-e artist known as [c4]Old Man Kanzo[c0]. His art didn't sell much, but he often looked after Toki while Jinkichi and Koma were out working.
Young Toki heard Seiman's talk about the Rite of Resurrection, but—being too young to comprehend it—regaled it to Old Man Kanzo as a story of fiction. Old Man Kanzo, inspired by the story and filled with renewed vigor, put his heart and soul into his next painting. The piece, centered around the theme of resurrection, became an instant hit in town.
Jinkichi, being a shrewd businessman, saw an opportunity and jumped on the bandwagon by carving netsuke connected to Old Man Kanzo's ukiyo-e. He made up stories about his netsuke, telling the people that their blessings were connected to resurrection, and his business rapidly flourished.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
""That man unknowingly left us a wonderful gift,"" thought Jinkichi and his family, but they were unaware of the tragedy that would soon unfold.
Before long, word of Old Man Kanzo's wonderful ukiyo-e reached the ears of the local daimyo and he was summoned to the lord's residence. But what awaited him was not praise, but cruel torture at the hands of Ashino, a female onmyoji who was in pursuit of Seiman. It was her who pressured Seiman into researching the Rite of Resurrection, which she secretly planned to use to preserve her beauty for all eternity.
Ashino took advantage of the fact that the daimyo's heart was weak and frail following the loss of his family, and manipulated him into capturing Old Man Kanzo, the source of the recent rumors about resurrection.
""Tell me where you heard of the Rite of Resurrection!"" Ashino demanded, as the brutal beatings continued.
It was said that the eerie sound of the beatings rang out like the beating of a taiko drum night after night, reaching even the watchtower of the Tsugaru residence.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
In the end, Ashino's cruel torture secured her the information on Jinkichi's family and the existence of the Record of Fates. The daimyo sent his [c4]chief retainer[c0] to bring in Jinkichi and the torture resumed afresh with the new captive. This time she intended to obtain the whereabouts of Seiman and the location of the Record of Fates. Jinkichi didn't know where Seiman went, but even if he did he had no intention of telling and stubbornly kept his mouth shut. The torture was pushed too far and Jinkichi was unintentionally killed before he spoke a word. The daimyo had Jinkichi's corpse hanged from a beech tree and declared that, ""Unable to bear the guilt of the crime of deceiving the masses with false rumors of resurrection, Jinkichi had committed suicide.""
This too was all part of Ashino's plan to send a message to the common folk, especially the increasing number of those who sought out the Rite for themselves.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
News of what happened to Jinkichi spread and people lost interest in the rite, wondering if the stories of resurrection were all but a lie. But rumors that the daimyo's word was perhaps not all that truthful spread quickly when a dancer claimed to have witnessed the chief retainer's cold-blooded handiwork firsthand, and Honjo fell into unrest once more.
The chief retainer arrested the girl and proposed a deal to put a stop to the rumors. The girl was to say she just wanted attention and retract her story by saying it was entirely made up. In exchange she would be given a most wondrous stage to perform on, but when the day came she was suffocated by the mask prepared for the performance. Unbeknownst to her, the mask had been covered in glue as part of the plan to kill and silence her.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
Koma never believed for a moment that her husband Jinkichi had committed suicide. She was certain someone was behind his death and asked around persistently for the names, addresses, and any other information she could find on people with connections to the daimyo.
The chief retainer would not allow things to escalate any further and had [c4]Tomezo[c0], a ronin who once served as a spy, go after her. However, she turned the table on him, shouting ""It was you who killed my husband, wasn't it!?"" Confronted with the accusation, Tomezo flew into a blind rage and cut Koma down in broad daylight. Ordered to take responsibility for his failure by committing seppuku, he exposed the daimyo's plot as he disemboweled himself by the lantern of the soba cart used to give coded signals.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
With both her parents gone through means unbeknownst to her, Toki found herself to be all alone. One day, late at night, she went searching for her parents and met her doom falling into a canal where she drowned.
Meanwhile, the chief retainer had made no headway whatsoever in finding Seiman's whereabouts, and an incensed Ashino decided to set fire to his residence, burning him alive.
In truth, all those connected to these events thus far were cursed by Ashino so that their souls would turn into soul dregs upon death, which she had been collecting. All she needed to perform the Rite now was to get her hands on the Record of Fates.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
Sensing that there was something serious at work behind the recent string of strange events in Honjo, Seiman returned to find he was too late. He broke down in tears when he learned of the unfortunate and unnatural deaths Jinkichi's family had met.
Seiman realized it was the handiwork of Ashino when he found their soul dregs had been collected, and decided he had to prevent any further sacrifices from happening by confronting her on Ho'on-ji Bridge.
What ensued was a fierce battle of spells that endured till the break of dawn, though those who did not know any better only saw what they believed to be eerie flashes and supernatural orbs of light.
At the end of the long battle, Ashino defeated Seiman and obtained the Record of Fates, but he had placed a curse upon her foot. Ashino dragged her foot, corrupted and horribly inflamed, and sought refuge at the nearby residence of a retainer and angrily demanded they wash her foot.
Ashino died then and there, filled with agony and her foot cursed and rotten. Seiman too, having sustained serious wounds during their fight, died that day on Ho'on-ji Bridge, still filled with regret.

However, Seiman came back to life. Knowing that there would be enough soul dregs in place during their confrontation, he had prepared a spell that would activate the Rite of Resurrection upon his passing. Feeling that his curiosity was responsible for the terrible tragedy that had unfolded, he was left with a keen understanding of why the Rite of Resurrection was forbidden and became determined to seal it away. Indeed, the reason he'd resurrected himself was for that very purpose.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
However, he did not know what had become of the Record of Fates. With nothing to seal away, he instead used the remaining soul dregs to turn nine of the netsuke made by Jinkichi into ritual implements to be sealed away in Honjo.
He placed a spell so that should someone try to activate the Rite of Resurrection again, all nine pieces will awaken at once. And to pass the whole truth of these events to future generations, he wrote everything down in the ""Record of Fates Yin Scroll"" and passed it down to his descendants.

Harue Shigima's son, Shuichi (age eleven), was kidnapped on his way home from school, with a ransom being demanded that same evening.
Initially, the kidnapping was thought of as a simple extortion scheme, but when it came to light that the Shigima family was closely tied to the police—and Shuichi was in fact the grandson of a senior official—it was quickly assumed that the perpetrator was acting upon a grudge against the police force.
The kidnapping was treated as a direct attack against the good name of the police, and a large-scale investigation was launched that used the best equipment available to trace phone calls.
This made it all the more embarrassing when they were unable to catch the culprit, losing the public's confidence.
The culprit grew cocky, relentlessly mocking the police force.
After three days of failure after failure, Harue reached a breaking point.
Spurred by concern for her son, she resolved to hand over the ransom money as fast as possible, but her husband and father—who held the prestige of the police in high regard—refused, saying that they would not let the criminal win by giving in to their demands.
The increasingly frantic detective assigned to the case lost his temper when the criminal called to give an ultimatum, causing the culprit to never make contact again.
Another week passed, and Shuichi's body was found floating in the Sumida River.

As the name suggests, it specializes in the investigation and resolution of cases involving paranormal phenomena. Since the existence of paranormal phenomena is not public knowledge, nor is it readily believed by the general population, the bureau's activities are conducted in the utmost secrecy. Currently, there are only five members, including the chief. The bureau has a network of psychic contacts across the country who assist with their cases, including Mio Kurosuzu.
The bureau undertakes investigations into any suspicious stories that cross their desk, though the vast majority turn out to be hoaxes. Due to the sheer volume of cases, close-lipped, experienced detectives without paranormal abilities of their own, such as Tetsuo Tsutsumi, are sometimes assigned to investigate.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
The current chief of Paranormal Affairs is a man named [c4]Kuiru Nakagoshi[c0]. He was born to a family of psychics who have been involved in keeping the world safe from paranormal phenomena for generations, and has served as Mio Kurosuzu's mentor since discovering her. Kuiru is an elusive figure—very few have met him in person, and he is rarely seen in the office. It is said that this is because he has oft been the target of curses, however some theorize that it is in fact because Kuiru is not actually of flesh-and-blood at all. His seat in his office is usually occupied by a nue, a legendary creature found in Japanese folklore. The nue resembles an ordinary White's thrush and acts as Kuiru's messenger, leading to bizarre scenes of police officers earnestly reporting their findings to a bird.
The term ""Nakagoshi case"" serves as a code name used to refer to cases under investigation by Paranormal Affairs.","DOC40_ST_0002","False","","",""

Even his own assistant has referred to the name as ""confusing at best."" After all, rather than an azure heron, Richter keeps a white parrot as a pet and dresses not in blue, but mostly in white. If there was a symbolic connection to be made here, it has surely been lost on all but Richter himself.

A private investigator, also known as a private eye, is a detective who operates their own agency. Although there are no formal qualifications necessary to become a private investigator, many are retired police agents or detectives due to the similarities between the work involved.
At a glance, private investigation firms and inquiry offices might look similar, but they carry out different types of investigations. Inquiry offices specialize in conducting credit checks on businesses, while private investigators are generally involved in tailing persons of interest and gaining information surreptitiously.","DOC41_ST_0002","False","","",""

","A notorious case from over two decades ago involving the murder of a female high school student.
It first came to the attention of the authorities when part of a human left hand was discovered floating in the Sumida River. Testing revealed it to belong to a missing female high school student. As it appeared to have been severed deliberately, the police launched a murder investigation.
A large-scale search of the river was organized, but the highly polluted state of the water made this impossible: visibility was poor, the stench was intense, and the divers quickly fell ill. They succeeded in recovering only the victim's head and what appeared to be part of her leg before the search was called off.
At the time of the incident, the Sumida River was as polluted as it had ever been; neither fish nor shellfish could survive in it, eventually causing the annual fireworks festival to be called off indefinitely.
Over the course of the search, the police discovered a number of unidentified human bones. This caused a stir among the public, as several other young women had gone missing in recent years in the Tokyo area, and it was feared that they may have fallen victim to the same fate. Forensic technologies at the time, however, were not advanced enough to determine the identities of the deceased, and so the police were unable to open any inquiries.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
Due to the overwhelming lack of circumstantial evidence, the investigation ground to a halt until a hitherto unrelated individual came to its attention. During a questioning about a separate incident, Fumichika Nejima, a thirty-six-year-old shop owner with no relation to the victim, divulged details about her that had never been released to the general public. An investigation into his background was conducted, leading to his arrest.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
Nejima testified that he had snatched his victim from the street and confined her in the underground storeroom of his shop, which also served as his living quarters. He chose her for no special reason, but simply decided she was an opportune target on seeing her walking alone at night.
After keeping her locked up for several days, he restrained her, sewed her mouth shut, and severed her fingers and toes with a box cutter while she was still conscious. As she screamed silently behind her sealed lips, he proceeded to her wrists, her ankles, her elbows, her knees, working his way inwards slowly and methodically. His victim constantly wavered in and out of consciousness. Her ordeal continued until she died of blood loss.
Nejima dismembered the rest of her body and disposed of it behind his home in the Sumida River before cleaning his storeroom and returning to his everyday routine as if nothing had happened.
The brutality of his actions shocked the nation when they were eventually reported.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
Once apprehended, Nejima readily divulged the details of the murder, but was less willing to explain his motive. When asked, he would only break down in tears, saying, ""I don't know what came over me. I know it was wrong."" In the end, the police could extract nothing more from him than expressions of remorse. Although the efficiency of his methods strongly suggested that he had committed similar crimes in the past, no corroborating evidence ever came to light.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
Nejima was sentenced to life in prison at his first hearing. The sentence was imposed with no appeal from the defendant.","DOC46_ST_0002","False","","",""

In the Middle Ages, the line between science and magic was blurred, with the pursuit of the supernatural considered a legitimate academic discipline. Astrology was regarded akin to astronomy, while alchemy was accepted as scientific fact and would eventually evolve into what is known today as chemistry.
One discipline, however, was considered wicked and shunned accordingly: black magic. The practice of using magical knowledge to strike a bargain with demons.
[c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0]
In contrast to the socially acceptable subjects studied by the intelligentsia, black magic was most prolific among the lower classes. It was the common people who suffered most from the ills of the day—war, famine, and sickness—which perhaps led them to seek aid from unholy powers.
As heresy, these rituals and spells were nowhere to be found in orthodox modes of teaching, but instead were recorded in tomes of dubious credibility.","DOC49_ST_0002","False","","",""

a0_010_0290,Hey, that's not a proper answer.[r]Earth to Shogo Okiie![l][p]
a0_010_0291,What do you think you're doing, falling asleep[r]here? You gave me quite the shock.[l][p]

a0_010_0313,Oh no, you look so confused... You're messing[r]with me, right? Stop it! You're scaring me![l][p]
a0_010_0314,All right, let's just calm down.[r]Take a good look around you, okay?[l][p]
a0_010_0315,Huh...?[l][p]
a0_010_0316,Wait a second...[r]When did I tell you about that?[l][p]
a0_010_0317,I mean...I guess I must have, seeing as you know[r]that name, but... Weird.[l][p]
a0_010_0318,Anyway, you still seem a little out of it.[r]Why don't you look around a bit more?[l][p]

a0_010_0321,That's [c4]Yoko Fukunaga[c0].[r]Good, at least I can remember that much.[l][p]
a0_010_0322,I first met her about a month ago.[r]She's twenty-three, works as a housekeeper,[r]and is really into the occult.[l][p]
a0_010_0323,If I think harder, I can probably [c3]recall[c0][r]a little more about what's going on.[l][p]
a0_010_0324,We've only met a few times, but we've really[r]hit it off. She's a lot of fun to be around.[l][p]
a0_010_0325,I have no idea how she feels, though. I get the[r]sense she isn't thinking about me that way[r]right now.[l][p]
a0_010_0326,But I know I've got a thing for bubbly girls[r]who are into dark things like the occult.[l][p]

a0_010_0329,There she is.[l][p]
a0_010_0330,She's back to digging up holes in the sandbox[r]and searching around the playground.[l][p]
a0_010_0331,She seems to be enjoying herself, talking to the[r]animal figures and petting them on their heads.[l][p]
a0_010_0332,No animal needs that much petting...[l][p]
a0_010_0333,Jeez, she's still at it...[l][p]
a0_010_0334,Hmm... Where are we...?[l][p]
a0_010_0335,Oh, right. This is [c4]Sumida City, Tokyo[c0].[r]We're at [c4]Kinshibori Park[c0] near Kinshicho Station.[l][p]
a0_010_0336,Yoko brought me here saying she needed my help[r]with something important.[l][p]
a0_010_0337,It's just past midnight.[r]That explains why there's nobody else around.[l][p]
a0_010_0338,This is the park near Kinshicho Station in Sumida.[l][p]
a0_010_0339,According to Yoko...[l][p]
a0_010_0340,The Whispering Canal, one of the Seven Mysteries[r]of Honjo, is around here somewhere.[l][p]
a0_010_0341,It's apparently the story that the expression[r]"left at the canal" originally comes from.[l][p]
a0_010_0342,I think I left myself a note about it.[r] I should check my [c4]Files[c0].[l][p]
a0_010_0343,These [c4]telephone booths[c0] are all over town.[r]The lights are always on so they can be used[r]in an emergency.[l][p]
a0_010_0344,That's an...interesting-looking playground.[l][p]
a0_010_0345,I bet it's crawling with kids during the daytime,[r]but it's kind of peaceful here at night.[l][p]
a0_010_0346,<i>Urgh... I'm still a little woozy.[r]What the hell is wrong with me?[l][p]
a0_010_0347,<i>Wait... Where am I?[r]I should take a look around.[l][p]
a0_010_0348,<i>There's a girl here.[r]Umm... Who is she?[l][p]
a0_010_0349,<i>Let me think... What can I remember...?[l][p]
a0_010_0350,<i>Okay, her name is Yoko Fukunaga. We met about[r]a month ago. What's the deal with this park...?[l][p]
a0_010_0351,<i>That's right. She asked me to come here to help[r]her look for one of the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
a0_010_0352,<i>Actually, I think I did some research into the[r][c4]Seven Mysteries of Honjo[c0].[l][p]
a0_010_0353,<i>I can't remember all too well. I should check[r]my Files.[l][p]
a0_010_0354,<i>It was around noon on one of my days off.[r]I had just finished running some errands in[r]Kinshicho and was here taking a quick break.[l][p]
a0_010_0355,<i>I was just looking around absentmindedly...[l][p]
a0_010_0356,<i>when I noticed this girl loitering about.[l][p]
a0_010_0357,<i>She was digging up holes in the sandbox and[r]searching around the playground.[l][p]
a0_010_0358,<i>She seemed to be enjoying herself, talking to the[r]animal figures and petting them on their heads.[l][p]
a0_010_0359,<i>My curiosity got the better of me before long,[r]and I struck up a conversation.[l][p]
a0_010_0360,Hey. Are you...looking for something?[l][p]
a0_010_0361,Hm...?[l][p]
a0_010_0362,Ah... Sorry. I must look like a total weirdo.[l][p]
a0_010_0363,Umm, yeah... I guess you could say I'm looking[r]for something.[l][p]
a0_010_0364,If you want, I could give you a hand.[l][p]
a0_010_0365,Really!? I mean, that'd be a huge help...but...[l][p]
a0_010_0366,But...?[l][p]
a0_010_0367,Are you really just a good Samaritan?[r]Or are you after...you know...something else?[l][p]
a0_010_0368,Huh...?[l][p]
a0_010_0369,Oh, wow! My hero! People like you really do[r]exist! I think I might cry...[l][p]
a0_010_0370,Haha. You're funny![r]Hey, at least you're up-front about it.[l][p]
a0_010_0371,Okay! I guess I'll let you help me! Be warned,[r]you might regret what you've gotten yourself into.[l][p]
a0_010_0372,No worries. What are you looking for, anyway?[r]Did you lose a bracelet or something?[l][p]
a0_010_0373,Not exactly. I'm searching for one of the Seven[r]Mysteries. Supposedly, this is the location of[r][c4]the Whispering Canal[c0].[l][p]
a0_010_0374,The what?[l][p]
a0_010_0375,Now I've done it. I bet you think[r]I'm some kind of lunatic.[l][p]
a0_010_0376,The [c4]Seven Mysteries of Honjo[c0]...[r]Do you know anything about it?[l][p]
a0_010_0377,I figured everyone around here would've at least[r]heard of it, but I guess not.[l][p]
a0_010_0378,[c3]Honjo[c0] is what the southern part of Sumida[r]is called.[l][p]
a0_010_0379,A long time ago, this part of Tokyo was split[r]into two separate cities. The north part was[r]Mukojima, and the south part was Honjo.[l][p]
a0_010_0380,Huh.[l][p]
a0_010_0381,Ah... Am I boring you?[l][p]
a0_010_0382,Well, I'm not a local or anything.[r]I just work around here.[l][p]
a0_010_0383,Oh! Then no wonder you didn't know.[l][p]
a0_010_0384,Well, the Seven Mysteries of Honjo is a legend[r]dating all the way back to the Edo period.[l][p]
a0_010_0385,Really? It's that old?[l][p]
a0_010_0386,That's, like...over two hundred years ago.[l][p]
a0_010_0387,Oh! I've got your attention after all![l][p]
a0_010_0388,I just assumed it was one of those fake stories[r]made up to chase the [c4]occult craze[c0].[l][p]
a0_010_0389,Haha, I don't blame you. A lot of the popular[r]stories going around are pretty fishy.[l][p]
a0_010_0390,But the Seven Mysteries of Honjo are different.[r]Because they're all true![l][p]
a0_010_0391,They're true...?[l][p]
a0_010_0392,That's what I said! They're the real deal![l][p]
a0_010_0393,So, hold on... What does that mean?[l][p]
a0_010_0394,Are you telling me there's actually paranormal[r]stuff at work in this park?[l][p]
a0_010_0395,Yep! Pretty much![l][p]
a0_010_0396,But there's got to be more to it. After all[r]I've done, I still haven't found a thing.[l][p]
a0_010_0397,That was the first time I met Yoko Fukunaga.[l][p]
a0_010_0398,We exchanged contact information, and we've talked[r]on the phone a few times since. We've even met in[r]person once or twice.[l][p]
a0_010_0399,But she never brought up the Seven Mysteries of[r]Honjo again. I figured she'd gotten bored of it.
a0_010_0400,Until today, when all of a sudden she decided[r]to resume her search.[l][p]
a0_010_0401,Huh? Wait a second...[r]Where did Yoko go?[l][p]
a0_010_0402,Oh, wait. She's coming back this way.[l][p]
a0_010_0403,Hey... What was that just now?[l][p]
a0_010_0404,Huh?[l][p]
a0_010_0405,Didn't you hear that?[l][p]
a0_010_0406,I did feel like I heard something...[r]I'm not too sure, though.[l][p]
a0_010_0407,Hmm... That was creepy.[l][p]
a0_010_0408,No, I didn't hear anything.[r]You sure you didn't just imagine it?[l][p]
a0_010_0409,Hmm... Maybe I did...[l][p]
a0_010_0410,But your special talent! You should've been able[r]to hear it. Pay closer attention for me, okay?[l][p]
a0_010_0411,My special talent? What are you talking about?[l][p]
a0_010_0412,Huh? I mean your spirit sense. You look like[r]you can handle your liquor.[l][p]
a0_010_0413,Huh?[l][p]
a0_010_0414,I have no idea what drinking has to do with it,[r]but...I don't think so.[l][p]
a0_010_0415,Hm? Well, you must.[l][p]
a0_010_0416,I mean... You can see me, right?
a0_010_0417,Huh?[l][p]
a0_020_0001,Start from beginning

a0_020_0446,About what?[l][p]
a0_020_0447,I mean, just now...[l][p]
a0_020_0448,It kinda sounded like you were saying that[r]only people with spirit sense can see you.[l][p]
a0_020_0449,Of course that was a joke. Duh! You don't really[r]think I'm some kind of evil spirit, do you?[l][p]
a0_020_0450,But yeah...[l][p]
a0_020_0451,I meant what I said about your spirit sense being[r]strong. I bet you could down a whole gimlet in[r]one gulp! Seriously![l][p]
a0_020_0452,That's the real reason I asked you to help me[r]with this Seven Mysteries of Honjo business.[l][p]
a0_020_0453,Okay. Let me just clarify something.[l][p]
a0_020_0454,Are you saying...you can actually see[r]paranormal stuff?[l][p]
a0_020_0455,Sure! I could handle a solid Moscow Mule.[l][p]
a0_020_0456,Why are you measuring this in terms of cocktails?[l][p]
a0_020_0457,Not a believer, huh? Well, that's no matter.[l][p]
a0_020_0458,But you have to have seen some weird stuff[r]over the years, right?[l][p]
a0_020_0459,Weird stuff?[l][p]
a0_020_0460,Yeah, like...things you could see but could[r]never understand.[l][p]
a0_020_0461,You can't be serious.[l][p]
a0_020_0462,I've seen ghost photos in magazines before, but...[r]are you telling me they really exist?[l][p]
a0_020_0463,You bet they do! But you can only recognize them[r]if you really believe in them. So be careful![l][p]
a0_020_0464,So, even with my skill I won't be able to see them[r]if I doubt that they exist?[l][p]
a0_020_0465,That's right! The spirit world is all about the[r]mind and the soul. You won't be able to see a[r]thing unless you're properly in tune.[l][p]
a0_020_0466,But sometimes people get caught up in the moment,[r]thinking they might see something, and then they[r]really do—because they believed they would.[l][p]
a0_020_0467,Is that how that works...[l][p]
a0_020_0468,Yep! Just like drinking. You'll never know how[r]much booze you can handle unless you're ready[r]to down some shots![l][p]
a0_020_0469,I'm still not sure I get the drinking thing.[l][p]
a0_020_0470,Haha! You know, I realized how strange it was[r]as the words left my mouth.[l][p]
a0_020_0471,Sheesh...[l][p]
a0_020_0472,...And if you can believe that, there might be[r]hope for you yet![l][p]
a0_020_0473,You can't be serious.[l][p]
a0_020_0474,Oh, by the way... Were we talking about the[r][c4]Rite of Resurrection[c0]?[l][p]
a0_020_0475,Ooh. Your memory is as strong as your tolerance.[r]I'm gonna start calling you Martini Man Shogo![l][p]
a0_020_0476,I'm really climbing up the drinks menu, huh?[l][p]
a0_020_0477,So, you know about it, huh?[r]The Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
a0_020_0478,A magazine ran a feature on it recently that[r]got practically [c3]everyone talking about it[c0].[l][p]
a0_020_0479,Really? Maybe that's where I heard about it.[l][p]
a0_020_0480,Still, I dunno... It seems a little too[r]far-fetched to be true.[l][p]
a0_020_0481,So, the Rite of Resurrection![l][p]
a0_020_0482,It's the forbidden art of bringing the dead back[r]to life, concocted by a famous onmyoji from an[r]ancient age...[l][p]
a0_020_0483,Rumor has it an old manuscript containing actual,[r]concrete details about the Rite was recently[r]discovered![l][p]
a0_020_0484,This rumor comes from a presentation given by[r]local historian Hideki Araishi at an[r]academic conference.[l][p]
a0_020_0485,You sure know a lot about this stuff.[l][p]
a0_020_0486,That's because...I'm secretly a huge occult buff![l][p]
a0_020_0487,I kinda got that.[l][p]
a0_020_0488,Oh.[l][p]
a0_020_0489,But if a researcher spoke about it at an academic[r]conference, it must have some basis in fact.[l][p]
a0_020_0490,Exactly! That's why I believe the Rite of[r]Resurrection is real![l][p]
a0_020_0491,Now I'm starting to believe it, too...[l][p]
a0_020_0492,Good![r]The pursuit of the unknown starts with belief![l][p]
a0_020_0493,I got that from Professor Araishi himself.[l][p]
a0_020_0494,Hmm...[l][p]
a0_020_0495,The Rite of Resurrection is real.[r]I know it is...[l][p]
a0_020_0496,I just remembered. I actually did some research[r]on the Seven Mysteries of Honjo at the library.[l][p]
a0_020_0497,You did!? What did you find?[l][p]
a0_020_0498,Well, I discovered a few interesting things.[l][p]
a0_020_0499,Oho! Tell me everything![l][p]
a0_020_0500,What about the Seven Mysteries of Honjo caught[r]your attention?
a0_020_0501,Although they're called the Seven Mysteries,[r]the literature lists nine of them.[l][p]
a0_020_0502,Ooh, I'm surprised you picked up on that.[r]Nice researching![l][p]
a0_020_0503,Some people think there could be up to fifteen.[r]That's the thing about these old folktales.[r]Stuff gets added to them over the years.[l][p]
a0_020_0504,That's more extra stories than main ones![l][p]
a0_020_0505,Yeah, but "the Seven Mysteries" rolls off the[r]tongue way better than "nine" or "fifteen."[l][p]
a0_020_0506,If you say so...[l][p]
a0_020_0507,But it makes sense, don't you think? It's more[r]likely to be passed on if it's easy to remember.[l][p]
a0_020_0508,Huh. That's a good point.[l][p]
a0_020_0509,So... I read some of the stories, and none of them[r]were...well, scary. I thought these were supposed[r]to be ghost stories?[l][p]
a0_020_0510,That's true. They're more like a collection of[r]superstitions, really.[l][p]
a0_020_0511,But there are some pretty disturbing ones in[r]the mix.[l][p]
a0_020_0512,Yeah, like the one that's supposed to take place[r]here. The Whispering Canal.[l][p]
a0_020_0513,People who fished in this canal would hear a[r]voice call out saying, "Leave it!" They had to[r]abandon their catch or the canal would take it.[l][p]
a0_020_0514,Right, right.[l][p]
a0_020_0515,Is that what you're expecting to find here in[r]this park?[l][p]
a0_020_0516,Um. Not quite.[l][p]
a0_020_0517,We're talking about a folktale from hundreds[r]of years ago.[l][p]
a0_020_0518,After centuries of the telephone game, who knows[r]if it's anything like the original story?[l][p]
a0_020_0519,So basically...[l][p]
a0_020_0520,You think the true story of the Whispering Canal[r]might be completely different from what we know?[l][p]
a0_020_0521,Exactly! I'm sure it is.[l][p]
a0_020_0522,I mean, weren't you curious?[l][p]
a0_020_0523,About what?[l][p]
a0_020_0524,People from around here have that expression[r]"left at the canal," right? Meaning to abandon[r]someone. This story is where it comes from.[l][p]
a0_020_0525,Except the story being told today is about fish.[r]There's nothing in it about leaving people behind.[l][p]
a0_020_0526,Now that you mention it, that's true...[l][p]
a0_020_0527,So you're saying the original story maybe did[r]involve someone being abandoned?[l][p]
a0_020_0528,That's what I'm trying to find out![l][p]
a0_020_0529,Ah... Gotcha.[l][p]
a0_020_0530,Totally unrelated, but do you actually drink?[r]Real alcohol, I mean.[l][p]
a0_020_0531,Whoa! Talk about whiplash.[r]I didn't expect you to start making small talk.[l][p]
a0_020_0532,Well... Our conversation was getting a bit dark.[l][p]
a0_020_0533,I figured a change of topic might lighten[r]things up.[l][p]
a0_020_0534,Oho, I see. If you really want to know...[l][p]
a0_020_0535,I like to think I can handle a few drinks.[l][p]
a0_020_0536,But to tell you the truth, I've never actually[r]had a Moscow Mule.[l][p]
a0_020_0537,Really, now?[l][p]
a0_020_0538,Heheh. I just thought it sounded cool.[r]I would like to try it, though.[l][p]
a0_020_0539,Why don't we go for a drink sometime, then?
a0_020_0540,Ooh, are you asking me out?[r]No, you're just being a good Samaritan, right?[l][p]
a0_020_0541,Ooh, are you asking me out?[r]Ahh, so you were after "something else"![l][p]
a0_020_0542,No, that's not what I meant...[l][p]
a0_020_0543,Haha, I'm just kidding![r]Yeah, I'd be up for that.[l][p]
a0_020_0544,But only if we find one of the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
a0_020_0545,All right, then let's get to work![l][p]
a0_020_0546,I bet you're a big drinker, aren't you?[r]I look forward to it![l][p]
a0_020_0547,It's gotten late. Really late, actually.[r]It's already past 1 a.m.[l][p]
a0_020_0548,There's a chill in the air...[r]But I guess that's normal for this time of year.[l][p]
a0_020_0549,...Or so I keep telling myself.[l][p]
a0_020_0550,These [c4]telephone booths[c0] are all over town.[r]The lights are always on so they can be used[r]in an emergency.[l][p]
a0_020_0551,That's an...interesting-looking playground.[l][p]
a0_020_0552,I bet it's crawling with kids during the daytime,[r]but it's kind of peaceful here at night.[l][p]
a0_020_0553,I don't know how she's so comfortable talking about[r]spirits and the paranormal at this time of night.[l][p]
a0_020_0554,Either she's got guts, or she's just used to it.[r]Unless... No, it can't be.[l][p]
a0_020_0555,<i>I've gotten most of my memory back, but I still[r]feel a bit out of it.[l][p]
a0_020_0556,Wait, hang on. I've got another question.[l][p]
a0_020_0557,Hm?[l][p]
a0_020_0558,You mentioned the Rite of Resurrection.[r]Are you looking for that, too?[l][p]
a0_020_0559,Does it have something to do with the Seven[r]Mysteries of Honjo?[l][p]
a0_020_0560,Ooh! You're sharp! I could cut my finger on you![l][p]
a0_020_0561,To tell the truth...[l][p]
a0_020_0562,It's actually the other way around.[l][p]
a0_020_0563,What do you mean?[l][p]
a0_020_0564,Hmm. Well...[l][p]
a0_020_0565,I started off searching for the Rite of[r]Resurrection.[l][p]
a0_020_0566,But along the way, I realized that I needed to[r]investigate the Seven Mysteries of Honjo first.[l][p]
a0_020_0567,I see. So then...[l][p]
a0_020_0568,If you're looking into a way to bring someone[r]back from the dead...[l][p]
a0_020_0569,Does that mean you've got someone you want[r]to bring back?[l][p]
a0_020_0570,...[l][p]
a0_020_0571,Um... You know what? Forget it.[l][p]
a0_020_0572,It just came to mind, so I thought I'd ask.[r]I didn't mean to pry. Sorry.[l][p]
a0_020_0573,...No, it's fine. I figured I'd need to tell[r]you at some point.[l][p]
a0_020_0574,...[l][p]
a0_020_0575,It's...Ogopogo.[l][p]
a0_020_0576,Ogopogo...?[l][p]
a0_020_0577,Yeah. I want to bring Ogopogo back to life.[l][p]
a0_020_0578,He died in an accident about a month ago...[l][p]
a0_020_0579,Ogopogo...died...?[l][p]
a0_020_0580,Oh, right. Ogopogo was my dog.[r]I had him for eight years.[l][p]
a0_020_0581,Ahh, okay. Your dog. Gotcha.[l][p]
a0_020_0582,You spent a long time together. Losing him[r]must have been really hard for you.[l][p]
a0_020_0583,Yeah... To be honest, I'm not sure if the Rite[r]even works on dogs.[l][p]
a0_020_0584,But as soon as I found out about it, I knew[r]I had to give it a try![l][p]
a0_020_0585,I don't think I could forgive myself if I just[r]let the opportunity pass by.[l][p]
a0_020_0586,Definitely. Now I understand why you feel so[r]strongly about it.[l][p]
a0_020_0587,Thanks for telling me. I know this must be[r]hard to talk about.[l][p]
a0_020_0588,Mm. But you know what? All that led to me[r]meeting you.[l][p]
a0_020_0589,So at least something good came out of it![l][p]
a0_020_0590,Though that doesn't mean I'll stop looking,[r]obviously![l][p]
a0_020_0591,Yoko...[l][p]
a0_020_0592,I'll do everything I can to help you![l][p]
a0_020_0593,Yay! I'm so glad to hear that![r]Let's keep up the hard work then, yeah?[l][p]
a0_020_0594,So...about the connection between this Rite and[r]the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
a0_020_0595,Putting together everything we've talked about...[l][p]
a0_020_0596,My guess is that the original stories behind[r]the Seven Mysteries—the true stories...[l][p]
a0_020_0597,are the key to finding the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
a0_020_0598,And that's why you're here searching for one of[r]them. Do I have that right?[l][p]
a0_020_0599,Wow, ten out of ten![r]You're proving to be quite the capable assistant![l][p]
a0_020_0600,Wait, since when was I your assistant?[l][p]
a0_020_0601,Anyway, this is all just hearsay, but...[l][p]
a0_020_0602,Some say that what led to the Seven Mysteries[r]coming to be...[l][p]
a0_020_0603,was the Rite of Resurrection itself.[l][p]
a0_020_0604,Huh? Don't the stories come from the Edo period?[l][p]
a0_020_0605,I thought the Rite of Resurrection was supposed[r]to be way older than that?[l][p]
a0_020_0606,Right. It seems that an onmyoji from the Edo[r]period rediscovered the ancient art.[l][p]
a0_020_0607,That old manuscript I mentioned with all the[r]details on how to use the Rite? Apparently it[r]was written in the Edo period.[l][p]
a0_020_0608,Oh, right, I never told you its name![r]The manuscript is called the [c4]Record of Fates[c0].[l][p]
a0_020_0609,Whoa. What a name.[l][p]
a0_020_0610,And it speculates that the secret of the Rite[r]is hidden within the Seven Mysteries of Honjo.[l][p]
a0_020_0611,So now, the Seven Mysteries are the hot new trend![l][p]
a0_020_0612,...Among who? You know, this whole thing's[r]starting to sound pretty questionable.[l][p]
a0_020_0613,Come on, remember what I said about the pursuit[r]of the unknown?[l][p]
a0_020_0614,It starts with belief. Right.[l][p]
a0_020_0615,Whoa!
a0_020_0616,What the hell...?![l][p]
a0_020_0617,It feels like...the air just changed...[l][p]
a0_020_0618,Yoko's pointing over here, but I don't see[r]anything out of the ordinary.[l][p]
a0_020_0619,Still, she looks really spooked.[r]I doubt she's making this up.[l][p]
a0_020_0620,Damn it! Did I miss it?[l][p]
a0_020_0621,I don't see anything I should be frightened of.[l][p]
a0_020_0622,But maybe...there's something there that[r]I can't see?[l][p]
a0_020_0623,<i>What was that just now?[l][p]
a0_020_0624,<i>Something's got Yoko really rattled.[l][p]
a0_020_0625,<i>There has to be something strange around here.[r]I should keep looking around.[l][p]
a0_020_0626,Urgh... I don't get this!
a0_020_0627,What's going on? Did something happen?[l][p]
a0_020_0628,Yoko...?[l][p]
a0_020_0629,Yoko! Are you okay?[l][p]
a0_020_0630,Ah... Aaah... Agh...![l][p]
a0_020_0631,Hey! What's wrong!? Stay with me![l][p]
a0_020_0632,No... This...this can't be![r]No! No! Aaa...aaah...![l][p]
a0_020_0633,Ah...aaagh...[r]Wh...why...? Aaaaaahhh!!![l][p]
a0_020_0634,AaaAAah...AAAaahhh...! AaaaAAHHH![r]AAAAAA...AAAAAAAAAHHH!!![l][p]
a0_020_0635,Yoko! YOKOOO!!![l][p]
a0_020_0636,It's no use. She's in no condition to talk.[l][p]
a0_020_0637,I feel...eyes...on my back...[r]I can't move...[l][p]
a0_020_0638,Is there...something...behind me...?[l][p]
a0_020_0639,Huh...?[l][p]
a0_020_0640,Huh!? What the...!?[l][p]
a0_020_0641,What is...!? S-s-something's...![r]What is it!? Why is this happening!?[l][p]
a0_020_0642,<i>...Huh? What!?[l][p]
a0_020_0643,<i>Is calling her name really going to help?[l][p]
a0_020_0644,<i>I'm already yelling as hard as I can.[r]Shouldn't I look for what's causing this?[l][p]
a0_020_0645,Yoko! Hang in there, Yoko![r]Look at me! You're going to be okay![l][p]
a0_020_0646,It's all right! There's nothing there![l][p]
a0_020_0647,Ah... Aaah... AAAAAAHHH...!!![l][p]

a0_030_0840,But...is it going to make a difference?[l][p]
a0_030_0841,Her body's gone stiff, and her skin is cold...[r]and I don't think she's breathing.[l][p]
a0_030_0842,She looks more like a mannequin than a person now.[l][p]
a0_030_0843,...I don't think there's any coming back[r]from that.[l][p]
a0_030_0844,I don't get it.[l][p]
a0_030_0845,Just a few minutes ago, we were chatting away[r]without a care in the world.[l][p]
a0_030_0846,Yoko...[l][p]
a0_030_0847,How did this happen?[l][p]
a0_030_0848,How could someone so bright and bubbly just...[r]suddenly drop dead?[l][p]
a0_030_0849,[s0][a0.5]Resurrect her.
a0_030_0850,Huh...?[l][p]
a0_030_0851,Oh... That's right...![l][p]
a0_030_0852,If that Rite of Resurrection she was talking[r]about really does exist...[l][p]
a0_030_0853,there might be a way to bring her back![l][p]
a0_030_0854,If someone can just drop dead out of nowhere[r]like...like they were cursed...[l][p]
a0_030_0855,then why shouldn't there be a way to bring[r]them back to life?[l][p]
a0_030_0856,Yoko believed in it, so if I believe in her...[r]it seems completely possible![l][p]
a0_030_0857,Maybe...just maybe... I can still save her![l][p]
a0_030_0858,Even if I've got to deal with spirit senses and[r]curses and whatever, I've got to try![l][p]
a0_030_0859,Wait for me, Yoko. I promise, I'll use the[r]Rite of Resurrection to bring you back![l][p]
a0_030_0860,Right before she died...I felt a strange presence[r]a few times.[l][p]
a0_030_0861,And it seemed like she saw something.[r]Something that shook her to the bone.[l][p]
a0_030_0862,There's definitely something strange going on...[r]and maybe it's still here.[l][p]
a0_030_0863,What could she have seen?[l][p]
a0_030_0864,She mentioned that the Rite of Resurrection and[r]Seven Mysteries were connected.[l][p]
a0_030_0865,So maybe, whatever it was she saw...[l][p]
a0_030_0866,had something to do with that Whispering Canal![l][p]
a0_030_0867,Whoa...!
a0_030_0868,Damn it... That presence again![l][p]
a0_030_0869,It must be around here somewhere...but where?[l][p]
a0_030_0870,Huh? There's something on the ground.[l][p]
a0_030_0871,Did Yoko drop this?
a0_030_0872,I didn't notice it till now, but there's a small[r]wooden sculpture by her side.[l][p]
a0_030_0873,It's three or four centimeters tall. It looks like[r]it could be a keychain, but from how rotted it[r]is, it's way too old for that.[l][p]
a0_030_0874,Despite how tiny it is, I feel an almost palpable[r]malice radiating from it.[r]...What the hell is this thing?[l][p]

a0_030_0895,<i>A murderous impulse seeps into my soul like[r]thick, black tar.[l][p]
a0_030_0896,[s0][a0.5]Now...
a0_030_0897,[s0][a0.5]Kill...
a0_030_0898,Can you hear it, Curse Bearer?[l][p]
a0_030_0899,You, who so strongly desires the Rite.[l][p]
a0_030_0900,Kill them.[l][p]
a0_030_0901,Should you seek life's restoration...[l][p]
a0_030_0902,Take your curse in hand...[l][p]
a0_030_0903,Reap lives by the score...[l][p]
a0_030_0904,And claim their soul dregs for your own.[l][p]
a0_030_0905,Collect enough to sate this vessel...[l][p]
a0_030_0906,And by their sacrifice claim the gift of resurrection.[l][p]
a0_030_0907,Or better yet...[l][p]
a0_030_0908,Slay your fellow curse bearers...[l][p]
a0_030_0909,For theirs are the equal of droves of lesser souls.[l][p]
a0_030_0910,Now, go forth and kill![l][p]
a0_030_0911,<i>...!?[l][p]
a0_030_0912,<i>What the hell was that?[l][p]
a0_030_0913,<i>It was like the curse's memories flowed[r]directly into my mind...[l][p]
a0_030_0914,<i>In an instant...I understood everything.[l][p]
a0_030_0915,<i>When I picked up this curse stone...[l][p]
a0_030_0916,<i>the Whispering Canal must have cursed me.[l][p]
a0_030_0917,<i>I also heard a strange voice...[l][p]
a0_030_0918,<i>It told me that if I want the Rite...[l][p]
a0_030_0919,<i>I have to kill a bunch of people with this curse[r]stone and collect their souls.[l][p]
a0_030_0920,<i>I guess it's good to know that the Rite really[r]exists...[l][p]
a0_030_0921,<i>But this thing wants me to kill people to get it?[l][p]
a0_030_0922,<i>Screw that![l][p]
a0_030_0923,<i>Putting my own life on the line is one thing...[l][p]
a0_030_0924,<i>Murdering other people is another thing entirely.[l][p]
a0_030_0925,<i>And not just one person, either.[r]Scores, it said...[l][p]
a0_030_0926,<i>So this is the curse of the Whispering Canal, huh?[l][p]
a0_030_0927,<i>A curse that traps the soul of anyone who tries[r]to walk away from me.[l][p]
a0_030_0928,But...[l][p]
a0_030_0929,if I use it...[l][p]
a0_030_0930,and collect enough souls...[l][p]
a0_030_0931,then I'll be able to bring Yoko back.[l][p]
a0_030_0932,<i>And there was something about other curse bearers[r]being worth more soul dregs...[l][p]
a0_030_0933,<i>...Jeez.[l][p]
a0_030_0934,<i>I'm really at a loss here...[l][p]
a0_030_0935,The cold night air feels like it's pressing[r]down on me.[l][p]
a0_030_0936,Just standing here makes me want to scream...[r]But I've got bigger problems right now.[l][p]
a0_030_0937,...!?[l][p]
a0_030_0938,It feels like I'm being watched...[r]Is someone there?[l][p]
a0_030_0939,Where are you...?[l][p]
a0_030_0940,...[l][p]
a0_030_0941,...Oh, of course.[r]I don't know how it took me so long to realize.[l][p]
a0_030_0942,This has to be some weird prank she's playing.[l][p]
a0_030_0943,Any second now, she's going to open her eyes,[r]get up, and have a good laugh at how scared I was.[l][p]
a0_030_0944,...[l][p]
a0_030_0945,Right, Yoko?[l][p]
a0_030_0946,You can give it up now.[l][p]
a0_030_0947,Boy, did I fall for that one![r]You really got me good![l][p]
a0_030_0948,Wait, no, I've got it![r]You really were some sort of spirit all along![l][p]
a0_030_0949,There's no way you're really dead...right?[l][p]
a0_030_0950,...[l][p]
a0_030_0951,...I'm not even fooling myself anymore.[l][p]
a0_030_0952,There's no going back. Only forward.[l][p]
a0_030_0953,It's hard to believe she was so full of life[r]just a few minutes ago...[l][p]
a0_030_0954,I've called an ambulance already.[r]It should be here soon.[l][p]
a0_030_0955,<i>There's something here, I know it.[r]I just need to look harder.[l][p]
a0_030_0956,<i>Although...if some innocent poking around about[r]the Seven Mysteries was enough to get Yoko[r]killed...[l][p]
a0_030_0957,<i>There's a good chance of the same thing[r]happening to me.[l][p]
a0_030_0958,<i>...[l][p]
a0_030_0959,<i>But I already knew that when I decided to get[r]involved.[l][p]
a0_030_0960,<i>Now I've got my own curse stone...and the curse[r]of the Whispering Canal.[l][p]
a0_030_0961,<i>I'm in way over my head.[l][p]
a0_030_0962,<i>Was Yoko the one who dropped this curse stone?[l][p]
a0_030_0963,<i>Does that mean she was the previous owner[r]of the curse of the Whispering Canal?[l][p]
a0_030_0964,<i>Then...did she know what the Rite of[r]Resurrection involved?[l][p]
a0_030_0965,<i>That man... Who is he?[r]He looks to be in his thirties or forties.[l][p]
a0_030_0966,<i>He's all dressed up in a suit and tie, but[r]somehow he looks real shady.[l][p]
a0_030_0967,<i>What's he doing here?[r]Was he watching us all this time?[l][p]
a0_030_0968,<i>Something tells me curses are nothing new to him.[l][p]
a0_030_0969,<i>If he's one of the other curse bearers...[l][p]
a0_030_0970,<i>then I need to be careful. He might be here to[r]kill me and take my curse stone.[l][p]
a0_030_0971,<i>But by the same token, killing him will net me[r]a lot of soul dregs.[l][p]
a0_030_0972,<i>If I want to use my curse on him...[l][p]
a0_030_0973,<i>I have to get him to walk away and leave me[r]behind.[l][p]
a0_030_0974,<i>Now... What would convince him to do that?[l][p]
a0_030_0975,<i>Scenario 1: He does what he came here to do.[r]Scenario 2: He suddenly needs to be somewhere else.[l][p]
a0_030_0976,<i>He's probably here for my curse stone, so I[r]don't think I'd get out of Scenario 1 alive.[l][p]
a0_030_0977,<i>Scenario 2 means hoping something will happen[r]by chance...and luck is rarely on my side.[l][p]
a0_030_0978,<i>So my only hope is Scenario 3:[r]Something makes it impossible for him to stay.[l][p]
a0_030_0979,<i>I don't have to keep him away forever. I just[r]need to get him to walk away once.[l][p]
a0_030_0980,<i>Wait! I've got it![l][p]
a0_030_0981,<i>I know how I can [c3]convince him to leave[c0]![l][p]
a0_030_0982,<i>Takumi Yumioka? How the hell does he know me?[l][p]
a0_030_0983,<i>It's not like I've been getting out much...[r]I barely have a life outside of work.[l][p]
a0_030_0984,<i>Wait! That's it![l][p]
a0_030_0985,<i>My work! That's how he knows me![l][p]
a0_030_0986,<i>I've never actually met him, so it totally[r]slipped my mind...![l][p]
a0_030_0987,<i>Suigen Gamyodo my ass.[r]This guy thinks he can sell me anything![l][p]
a0_030_0988,<i>But I don't know if having figured that out[r]helps me much right now...[l][p]
a0_030_0989,...Huh?[l][p]
a0_030_0990,The hell is that? It looks like a light...[r]floating in midair?[l][p]
a0_030_0991,Whoa! It's coming closer![l][p]
a0_030_0992,Is this another one of the Seven Mysteries?[l][p]
a0_030_0993,It looks like...a will-o'-wisp, maybe? Was there[r]anything like that in the Seven Mysteries?[l][p]
a0_030_0994,It's creeping me out, but it's staying put for[r]now. I should probably leave it be.[l][p]
a0_030_0995,...!?[l][p]
a0_030_0996,Now that I look closer...[r]Is there someone there?[l][p]
a0_030_0997,H-hey! Who's there!?[l][p]
a0_030_0998,...[l][p]
a0_030_0999,They must be ignoring me on purpose.[r]Maybe they're waiting to see what I do...[l][p]
a0_030_1000,...[l][p]
a0_030_1001,Oh, my. How unexpected.[l][p]
a0_030_1002,It was your curse that killed that poor woman,[r]I take it?[l][p]
a0_030_1003,Wha—!?[l][p]
a0_030_1004,Cat got your tongue...Mr. Okiie?
a0_030_1005,Huh?[l][p]
a0_030_1006,Who are you? And how do you know my name!?[l][p]
a0_030_1007,Do you mean to say you don't recognize me?[l][p]
a0_030_1008,This comes as a bit of a shock, I must say.[l][p]
a0_030_1009,Look a little harder, and I dare say it will[r]jog your memory.[l][p]
a0_030_1010,What's with this guy...?[l][p]
a0_030_1011,I still don't have a clue who you are.[l][p]
a0_030_1012,How do you know me? Have we met?[l][p]
a0_030_1013,Dear me. It is always humbling to find that[r]one is not as well-known as one believes.[l][p]
a0_030_1014,Perhaps my name will help you remember.[l][p]
a0_030_1015,I am [c4]Takumi Yumioka[c0].[l][p]
a0_030_1016,Takumi...Yumioka?[l][p]
a0_030_1017,Does that ring any bells?[l][p]
a0_030_1018,I...think I've heard that name somewhere[r]before...maybe...[l][p]
a0_030_1019,So you do not even know my name.[r]How disappointing.[l][p]
a0_030_1020,Disappointing...but fortuitous.[l][p]

a0_030_1023,Well then, Mr. Okiie, allow me to make you a[r]proposition.[l][p]
a0_030_1024,You have a curse stone in your possession.[r]I would like you to give it to me.
a0_030_1025,How do you know about that?[l][p]
a0_030_1026,Why, I saw the whole thing.[l][p]
a0_030_1027,That doesn't explain how you know what a[r]curse stone is.[l][p]
a0_030_1028,Even I barely have a handle on it.[l][p]
a0_030_1029,I can't. I need it to bring Yoko back to life.[l][p]
a0_030_1030,Oh, my.[l][p]
a0_030_1031,So you mean to use it, then.[l][p]
a0_030_1032,...![l][p]
a0_030_1033,You know about the Seven Mysteries of Honjo[r]and their curses and all that, don't you?[l][p]
a0_030_1034,But of course. Those curse stones...[l][p]
a0_030_1035,They are terribly dangerous things, capable of[r]killing without a trace so long as their[r]conditions are met.[l][p]
a0_030_1036,I hadn't thought of it that way, but...yeah.[l][p]
a0_030_1037,Imagine what might happen if one fell into[r]the wrong hands.[l][p]
a0_030_1038,They would be safer in mine, don't you agree?[l][p]
a0_030_1039,Although it seems I arrived too late to stop you[r]from killing that poor woman.
a0_030_1040,What are you—!? That wasn't me![l][p]
a0_030_1041,I am willing to overlook your indiscretion...[r]but only if you give me your curse stone.[l][p]
a0_030_1042,No way in hell![l][p]
a0_030_1043,For all I know, the wrong hands are yours![l][p]
a0_030_1044,Very well. I had hoped to settle this amicably,[r]but you leave me no choice...[l][p]
a0_030_1045,<i>This Takumi guy must have a curse stone of[r]his own.
a0_030_1046,<i>At least, it'd be safer to assume so.[l][p]
a0_030_1047,<i>It would explain how he knows so damn much.[l][p]
a0_030_1048,<i>So he can kill me instantly...as long as he[r]fulfills his stone's conditions.[l][p]
a0_030_1049,<i>Until I know what those conditions are,[r]I can't make any sudden moves.[l][p]
a0_030_1050,<i>I have to keep him talking, learn what I can,[r]and figure out a way to get my curse out first.[l][p]
a0_030_1051,<i>There's no way he has a curse stone of his own.[l][p]
a0_030_1052,<i>If he did, he wouldn't be so eager to get his[r]hands on mine.[l][p]
a0_030_1053,<i>He wants one of his own. They're that powerful...[r]and that dangerous.[l][p]
a0_030_1054,<i>By the sounds of it, if I give him the chance,[r]he'll try to take my curse stone by force.[l][p]
a0_030_1055,<i>I have to keep him talking and figure out a[r]way to get my curse out first.[l][p]
a0_030_1056,<i>How can I get him to leave me behind?[l][p]
a0_030_1057,<i>Though...it would be a waste not to take this[r]chance to find out about the other curse bearers...[l][p]
a0_030_1058,I need a topic that'll keep him talking.[r]My best bet would be...[l][p]
a0_030_1059,Before I give you my curse stone, I want to know[r]who you are.[l][p]
a0_030_1060,I need to know if I can trust you.[l][p]
a0_030_1061,...[l][p]
a0_030_1062,A reasonable enough concern.[l][p]
a0_030_1063,Very well... I am an associate of the great[r]sorcerer Suigen Gamyodo.[l][p]
a0_030_1064,Suigen...Gamyodo?[l][p]
a0_030_1065,Indeed. You must have heard of him? I believe[r]he was recently featured in a certain magazine.[l][p]
a0_030_1066,Your unfortunate companion there came seeking[r]his counsel not a few days ago.[l][p]
a0_030_1067,It was from her that I learned your name.[l][p]
a0_030_1068,I thought she would have mentioned me to you,[r]but it seems that was presumptuous of me.[l][p]
a0_030_1069,And when did this happen?[l][p]
a0_030_1070,Why, just two or three days ago.[l][p]
a0_030_1071,Gotcha.[l][p]
a0_030_1072,<i>Yeah, I'm not buying that.[l][p]
a0_030_1073,<i>He knows I don't know who he is, so he's just[r]trying to feed me a story.[l][p]
a0_030_1074,<i>I've only known Yoko for a month, but she[r]never mentioned going to see some mystic.[l][p]
a0_030_1075,<i>Although it is Yoko we're talking about here,[r]so it's hard to say for sure...[l][p]
a0_030_1076,I hope that is enough to convince you that[r]my hands are more than trustworthy.[l][p]
a0_030_1077,How do I know it wasn't you who killed Yoko[r]with your curse?[l][p]
a0_030_1078,Mr. Okiie, if you are hoping to trick me into[r]revealing whether I possess a curse stone,[r]I assure you, you cannot.[l][p]
a0_030_1079,...[l][p]
a0_030_1080,It is your curse that was responsible, Mr. Okiie,[r]no matter what you might tell yourself.[l][p]
a0_030_1081,That doesn't make sense.[r]I only found this after Yoko died.[l][p]
a0_030_1082,Oh?[l][p]
a0_030_1083,Don't play dumb.[r]I know you're the one who did this.[l][p]
a0_030_1084,Whether you choose to believe me is your[r]prerogative, but you are mistaken.[l][p]
a0_030_1085,But you should know that multiple curses awakened[r]at once at the stroke of midnight.[l][p]
a0_030_1086,There are many other curses in Honjo, and many[r]other curse bearers.[l][p]
a0_030_1087,Is it not premature of you to assume that I am[r]the one responsible?[l][p]
a0_030_1088,Wait. So you're saying that at midnight, a bunch[r]of people became curse bearers?[l][p]
a0_030_1089,There's no point in continuing this conversation.[r]For all I know, he could be telling me anything.[l][p]
a0_030_1090,Why are you so convinced it was my curse that[r]killed Yoko?[l][p]
a0_030_1091,Why, it is simply that...[l][p]
a0_030_1092,Hm...?[l][p]
a0_030_1093,Huh?[l][p]
a0_030_1094,I do believe I just saw your companion move.[l][p]
a0_030_1095,She what!?[l][p]
a0_030_1096,What are you doing? Should you not check on her?[l][p]
a0_030_1097,What do you want with my curse stone, anyway?[l][p]
a0_030_1098,I intend to seal it away in a secure location[r]so it may never be used again.[l][p]
a0_030_1099,I am certain that you, too, would rather be[r]free of this burden.[l][p]
a0_030_1100,The power to kill without fear of consequence is,[r]in itself, a curse.[l][p]
a0_030_1101,There are many ne'er-do-wells in this world[r]who could not resist the urge to use it.[l][p]
a0_030_1102,All the more so if promised the chance to[r]resurrect the dead.[l][p]
a0_030_1103,You'll "seal" it away? How?[l][p]
a0_030_1104,I will put it in the care of a sorcerer who is[r]well versed in supernatural matters.[l][p]
a0_030_1105,...[l][p]
a0_030_1106,If I have gained your trust, I must ask you[r]to hand me your curse stone.[l][p]
a0_030_1107,What's up with that weird ball of light?[r]Is that your curse?[l][p]
a0_030_1108,Whatever do you mean? I'm afraid I see no[r]such thing.[l][p]
a0_030_1109,...Huh?[l][p]
a0_030_1110,But it's right...[l][p]
a0_030_1111,Huh? It's gone! It was right there![l][p]
a0_030_1112,...[l][p]
a0_030_1113,I see. It seems you have become the mark of[r] another curse bearer.[l][p]
a0_030_1114,...!?[l][p]
a0_030_1115,For each of the Seven Mysteries, there's a curse[r]and a curse bearer, right?[l][p]
a0_030_1116,Do you know who any of the others are?[l][p]
a0_030_1117,And what would you do with that information?[l][p]
a0_030_1118,Your intentions are nothing untoward, I hope.[l][p]
a0_030_1119,...![l][p]
a0_030_1120,It is in the hearts of the selfish and insipid,[r]of those who would be most tempted by the Rite of[r]Resurrection, that the curses take root.[l][p]
a0_030_1121,And a curse's resentful memories impart a powerful[r]urge to kill...as I am certain you are aware.[l][p]
a0_030_1122,...![l][p]
a0_030_1123,You are a victim of circumstance, Mr. Okiie,[r]but your situation is exceedingly dangerous.[l][p]
a0_030_1124,You must relinquish your curse stone for your[r]own benefit...before it is too late.[l][p]
a0_030_1125,Too late?[l][p]
a0_030_1126,It's already too late! There's no going back![r]All I can do is keep pressing forward![l][p]
a0_030_1127,And if you're going to stand in my way...then[r]I'll have to stop you![l][p]
a0_030_1128,Am I to take that as a threat, Mr. Okiie?[l][p]
a0_030_1129,I would encourage you to exercise more discretion,[r]before you fall foul of a curse.[l][p]
a0_030_1130,Suigen Gamyodo my ass. I know who you are.[l][p]
a0_030_1131,You work at Hihaku Soaps, just like me.[r]You're the chairwoman's secretary.[l][p]
a0_030_1132,...[l][p]
a0_030_1133,Well, that took you long enough. Your lack of[r]company loyalty is frankly astounding.[l][p]
a0_030_1134,Allow me to reiterate my request, then—not as[r]a stranger, but as your superior.[l][p]
a0_030_1135,Hey, we're not at the office.[r]You don't get to push me around like that.[l][p]
a0_030_1136,...[l][p]
a0_030_1137,Why is our chairwoman's secretary even out[r]looking for curse stones, anyway?[l][p]
a0_030_1138,I refrained from revealing myself precisely to[r]avoid such questions, but I suppose needs must.[l][p]
a0_030_1139,Since the dawn of the Showa era, the land of Honjo[r]has nurtured our company's growth, and vice versa.[l][p]
a0_030_1140,It is our duty to ensure that curses do not[r]take root in this land we know as our home.[l][p]
a0_030_1141,I'm not sure I buy that.[l][p]
a0_030_1142,Like many things, it is not a matter that[r]concerns the rank and file.[l][p]
a0_030_1143,The chairwoman has no desire to spread fear[r]through our beloved company's birthplace.[l][p]
a0_030_1144,Now, if that is all, I must insist that you[r]hand me your curse stone.[l][p]
a0_030_1145,A tall, humorless-looking man.[r]He doesn't look familiar to me.[l][p]
a0_030_1146,He's acting like he knows me, though.[r]Have we met somewhere before?[l][p]
a0_030_1147,Takumi Yumioka, he said his name was.[l][p]
a0_030_1148,He hasn't taken his eyes off me for a second.[r]Even now, he's still staring right at me.[l][p]
a0_030_1149,Who the hell is he? Maybe if I focus, I can[r][c3]recall[c0] something useful...[l][p]
a0_030_1150,He works at Hihaku Soaps, just like me. He's the[r]secretary to the chairwoman, Natsue Yamamori.[l][p]
a0_030_1151,No wonder I didn't recognize him. He's way[r]above us lowly peons. I've only ever seen him[r]in the company bulletins.[l][p]
a0_030_1152,But he knew who I was... Could he have memorized[r]the names and faces of everyone in the company?![l][p]
a0_030_1153,Oh! Crap! I totally forgot![l][p]
a0_030_1154,What is it...?[l][p]
a0_030_1155,<i>What am I thinking!? If I give him the stone,[r]it's all over![l][p]
a0_030_1156,<i>Pull yourself together, Shogo Okiie.[r]You're smarter than that![l][p]
a0_030_1157,<i>How would that help?[r]If I said that, I'd be the one walking away![l][p]
a0_030_1158,<i>Pull yourself together, Shogo Okiie.[r]You're smarter than that![l][p]
a0_030_1159,Oh, right, I forgot to mention.[r]I called an ambulance![l][p]
a0_030_1160,It should be coming any minute now![l][p]
a0_030_1161,An ambulance?[l][p]
a0_030_1162,Have you lost your mind...?[l][p]
a0_030_1163,They will arrive to find you standing next to[r]a corpse, alone, in the dead of night.[l][p]
a0_030_1164,No doubt they will hand you over to the police,[r]who will have some questions for you.[l][p]
a0_030_1165,Probably. But I'm sticking with Yoko.[l][p]
a0_030_1166,Unless you want to join me in an interrogation[r]room, you'd better get out of here.[l][p]
a0_030_1167,...[l][p]
a0_030_1168,You're telling the truth, I see.[r]They are getting closer by the second.[l][p]
a0_030_1169,I cannot afford to be waylaid at this juncture.[r]I fear I must take my leave.
a0_030_1170,...![l][p]
a0_030_1171,Sooner or later, I will return for your curse[r]stone. I only hope you do not abuse it in the[r]meantime.[l][p]
a0_030_1172,...[l][p]
a0_030_1173,Well then, I bid you good evening.[l][p]

a0_040_0461,I left the park immediately.[l][p]
a0_040_0462,I felt bad for leaving Yoko, but I couldn't stay[r]there.[l][p]
a0_040_0463,The emergency medical services will probably[r]take care of her body. Takumi's too.[l][p]
a0_040_0464,This will be all over the news tomorrow.[l][p]
a0_040_0465,But until then, at least I know she'll be in[r]a safe place.[l][p]
a0_040_0466,All right.[l][p]
a0_040_0467,I have to find my next sacrifice quickly.[l][p]
a0_040_0468,I've got no time to waste. I need to find the[r]other curse bearers and collect their souls.[l][p]
a0_040_0469,Killing Takumi barely got me any soul dregs.[l][p]
a0_040_0470,I guess he mustn't have been a curse bearer after[r]all.[l][p]
a0_040_0471,It's not enough. The soul of a non-curse bearer[r]amounts to little more than leftover bread crumbs.[l][p]
a0_040_0472,I have to think of places where the other[r]curse bearers of the Seven Mysteries would be.[l][p]
a0_040_0473,The curses were activated at around midnight.[r]The others are bound to be active still.[l][p]
a0_040_0474,I should check to see if there are any other[r]places with connections to the mysteries nearby.[l][p]
a0_040_0475,At the very least, another curse bearer might be[r]thinking the same as me, meaning I could run into them.[l][p]
a0_040_0476,Let's see...which of the Seven Mysteries are[r]closest?[l][p]
a0_040_0477,I'm in the Kinshicho area right now.[l][p]
a0_040_0478,The Haunting Clappers are on the other side of[r]Oyoko River, just over [c3]Shumoku Bridge[c0][l][p]
a0_040_0479,The Foot-Washing Mansion and the Everburning Lantern[r]are around [c3]South Warigesui Street[c0], past the train tracks.[l][p]
a0_040_0480,And further along Oyoko River, I'll find the[r]Beckoning Light at [c3]Ho'onji Bridge[c0].[l][p]
a0_040_0481,Those three places are the closest. I guess I[r]should start there.[l][p]
a0_040_0482,<i>I'll collect the other curse bearers' souls[r]before dawn and bring Yoko back to life![l][p]
a0_040_0483,<i>I should go to another location connected[r]to the Seven Mysteries of Honjo.[l][p]

a0_040_0485,The Shumoku Bridge is supposedly where the bell[r]from the Haunting Clappers story used to be.[l][p]
a0_040_0486,I wandered around here for a while...but I didn't[r]see anything interesting.[l][p]
a0_040_0487,The only thing I found...[l][p]
a0_040_0488,was what looks like a [c3]100-yen lighter[c0][r]someone threw away.[l][p]

a0_040_0492,<i>Of course, I didn't just find a lighter.[r]There were a ton of cigarette butts strewn[r]across the ground too.[l][p]
a0_040_0493,<i>Seems like the place is well in need of some[r]wooden clappers to warn about fire.[l][p]

a0_040_0495,Both the Foot-Washing Mansion and the[r]Everburning Lantern are from this area.[l][p]
a0_040_0496,This late at night, even a road as big as this[r]one is silent as the grave.[l][p]
a0_040_0497,Is it just me, or is it oddly dark around here?[l][p]
a0_040_0498,Could this be...?[l][p]
a0_040_0499,I knew it. I can feel a strange presence in[r]the air.[l][p]
a0_040_0500,Whatever it is...I think it's still here.[l][p]
a0_040_0501,The Everburning Lantern's curse used to be here,[r]but it's gone now.[l][p]
a0_040_0502,I know it's past midnight...but it still seems[r]oddly dark around here.[l][p]
a0_040_0503,And this feeling...it's the same as from before.[l][p]
a0_040_0504,The air here is dark and suffocating.[l][p]
a0_040_0505,There are still other mysteries lurking around...[r]but it seems like this place is clear for now.[l][p]
a0_040_0506,There! There's something over there![l][p]
a0_040_0507,Is that a...curse echo? A curse of the Seven[r]Mysteries given form...[l][p]
a0_040_0508,I knew it! There's a curse bearer around here![l][p]
a0_040_0509,Is that curse echo what's causing this darkness?[l][p]
a0_040_0510,It doesn't seem hostile. Is it trying to tell me[r]to come closer? What should I do?[l][p]
a0_040_0511,No. Approaching it would be stupid. I should[r]keep my distance.[l][p]
a0_040_0512,Nothing's gonna happen if I just sit and wait.[r]Let's check it out.[l][p]

a0_040_0514,Darn it! Now what!?[l][p]
a0_040_0515,This isn't a curse doing this! Somebody's[r]pulling me in![l][p]
a0_040_0516,Agh... That hurt. It looks like I'm...inside a[r]building? Did it toss me in here?[l][p]
a0_040_0517,I can't see squat.[r]Is this the same darkness from the curse echo?[l][p]
a0_040_0518,I'm completely enclosed. Doesn't seem like[r]there's even a window. There's no telling which[r]direction I'm facing.[l][p]
a0_040_0519,<i>They got me! This has to be the work of[r]another curse bearer![l][p]
a0_040_0520,<i>Is this darkness because of a curse echo?[r]Are they trying to trap me here?[l][p]
a0_040_0521,<i>I guess I should be glad they haven't killed[r]me yet. If I don't start searching for a[r]way out...[l][p]
a0_040_0522,<i>Shit. I can't see a thing.[r]If only I had a source of light.[l][p]
a0_040_0523,I run into walls no matter where I feel[r]around myself.[l][p]
a0_040_0524,They're made of...concrete, I think? It's a pretty[r]small room.[l][p]
a0_040_0525,Maybe it's like a garage space or something.[r]I can't seem to find an exit though.[l][p]
a0_040_0526,That's right! I still have the lighter I picked[r]up earlier![l][p]
a0_040_0527,Perfect, it works! Now I can make out[r]my surroundings a bit better.[l][p]
a0_040_0528,What the...!?[l][p]
a0_040_0529,S-something...[l][p]
a0_040_0530,Drat, he's got a light! That ruins everything![l][p]
a0_040_0531,Is someone there!? Are you a curse bearer?[l][p]
a0_040_0532,It's over! Time to get out of here![l][p]
a0_040_0533,Wait, he's running? Was he right here this whole[r]time!?[l][p]
a0_040_0534,This is my chance![l][p]
a0_040_0535,Ack![l][p]
a0_040_0536,Graaahhh![r]Ungh! What the...!?[l][p]
a0_040_0537,Wh...ngh...why...!?[l][p]
a0_040_0538,Haah... Haah...[l][p]
a0_040_0539,That was a close one.[l][p]
a0_040_0540,I didn't catch a glimpse of the curse bearer,[r]but it seems like I'm all right.[l][p]
a0_040_0541,<i>His curse must have had something to do with[r]light and darkness. My guess would be...the[r]Everburning Lantern?[l][p]
a0_040_0542,<i>So there's a connection between the Seven[r]Mysteries and the way their curses work. That[r]might be useful to know.[l][p]

a0_040_0593,So, I guess you don't plan on telling me[r]anything either then.[l][p]
a0_040_0594,You can call me [c4]Richter Kai[c0], private detective.[l][p]
a0_040_0595,But didn't you just say not to...? Never mind.[l][p]
a0_040_0596,You say you're a detective?[l][p]
a0_040_0597,That's correct. I'm a man who deals in secrets.[l][p]
a0_040_0598,Don't expect me to share any more information[r]with you, though.[l][p]
a0_040_0599,I only told you so that we could have an[r]understanding.[l][p]

a0_040_0603,What's a detective doing around here?[l][p]
a0_040_0604,Working...and that's all I'll say 'bout that.[l][p]
a0_040_0605,I could ask you the same thing, though.[l][p]
a0_040_0606,This seems like a strange place to stop. What[r]brought you here?[l][p]
a0_040_0607,...[l][p]
a0_040_0608,I saw a strange man lurking around.[l][p]
a0_040_0609,I see. Then let me ask a different question.[l][p]
a0_040_0610,Why did you go out of your way to strike up a[r]conversation with that strange man?[l][p]
a0_040_0611,...[l][p]
a0_040_0612,I'm...looking for someone.[l][p]
a0_040_0613,I figured it was worth seeing if you knew[r]anything.[l][p]
a0_040_0614,You don't say. In that case, I just might be able[r]to help you.[l][p]
a0_040_0615,Can you describe the person you're looking for?[l][p]
a0_040_0616,...[l][p]
a0_040_0617,I know I said a person, but...I'm actually looking[r]for something called the Beckoning Light.[l][p]
a0_040_0618,Why should I tell you?[l][p]
a0_040_0619,I see. Clearly, you didn't stop here just for the[r]chance to talk to me.[l][p]
a0_040_0620,Which begs the question...what did you expect to[r]find here?[l][p]
a0_040_0621,...[l][p]
a0_040_0622,Maybe this bridge simply appeals to you?[l][p]
a0_040_0623,But then, why would you go out of your way to drop[r]by in the middle of the night?[l][p]
a0_040_0624,I'm looking for the Beckoning Light.[l][p]
a0_040_0625,The Beckoning Light?[l][p]
a0_040_0626,Aha. The Seven Mysteries of Honjo.[l][p]
a0_040_0627,That's right. A friend of mine was really into[r]that kind of stuff.[l][p]
a0_040_0628,She said the Beckoning Light appears here in the[r]middle of the night. I wanted to see for myself.[l][p]
a0_040_0629,Hahaha. Really! You're the adventurous[r]type, aren't you?[l][p]
a0_040_0630,Unfortunately, I think you're out of luck. I've[r]been here for a while, but I haven't seen any[r]strange lights.[l][p]
a0_040_0631,All right. Well, thanks for telling me.[l][p]
a0_040_0632,But just wait one second. There's still time left[r]for it to appear. Why don't we wait together?[l][p]
a0_040_0633,Thanks, but I think I'm good.[l][p]
a0_040_0634,Really? Well, I'm sorry I couldn't be of any[r]more help.[l][p]
a0_040_0635,No, don't worry about it. I think I'm in the wrong[r]place anyway.[l][p]
a0_040_0636,If you ever need a hand, I'd be happy to help.[r]It's all in a day's work for an investigator[r]extraordinaire.[l][p]
a0_040_0637,Thanks. I'll try looking somewhere else for now.[l][p]
a0_040_0638,Really? Well, I'm sorry I couldn't be of any[r]more help.[l][p]
a0_040_0639,Ah, that's right! I meant to ask.[l][p]
a0_040_0640,Do you have a light on you?[l][p]
a0_040_0641,A light? You mean, for cigarettes?[l][p]
a0_040_0642,Sorry, I don't. I'm not a smoker.[l][p]
a0_040_0643,Well, I've got this cheap one I picked up, but[r]that's it.[l][p]
a0_040_0644,Oh, no. This'll do nicely.[l][p]
a0_040_0645,Are you sure?[l][p]
a0_040_0646,Anyway, I should get back to work. Once you're[r]gone, of course.[l][p]
a0_040_0647,Is there a reason I can't be here?[l][p]
a0_040_0648,Of course. My work is top-secret.[l][p]
a0_040_0649,...[l][p]
a0_040_0650,Hardly anyone's around. Not surprising, seeing as[r]it's past two in the morning.[l][p]
a0_040_0651,It feels like the whole world's gone to sleep.[l][p]
a0_040_0652,Ho'onji Bridge has a pretty unusual structure.[r]The ends are stone, but the middle is steel.[l][p]
a0_040_0653,The Oyoko River beneath it is actually a canal[r]that was dug during the Edo period.[l][p]
a0_040_0654,The other side is an industrial district.[l][p]
a0_040_0655,And further down from the bridge is the temple[r]from which it gets its name.[l][p]
a0_040_0656,<i>The Beckoning Light should be around here[r]somewhere...[l][p]
a0_040_0657,<i>along with one super shady-looking guy.[l][p]
a0_040_0658,<i>Only a curse bearer would have any reason to be[r]here around this time. Maybe I should talk to him.[l][p]
a0_040_0659,<i>A detective? Really? Dressed like that?[l][p]
a0_040_0660,<i>He may look ridiculous, but he knows what he's[r]doing. I don't want him finding out about me.[l][p]
a0_040_0661,<i>I don't think he's a curse bearer, so I'm better[r]off just leaving him alone.[l][p]
a0_040_0662,<i>It doesn't seem like he has anything to do with[r]the curse bearers. I should move on.[l][p]
a0_040_0663,<i>If he's been here for as long as he says, there's[r]a good chance he's seen something...[l][p]
a0_040_0664,<i>But I don't think it's worth asking. He seems[r]like all kinds of trouble.[l][p]
a0_040_0665,The curse stone of the Whispering Canal,[r]one of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo.[r]It is currently [$102]% filled with soul dregs.[l][p]
a0_040_0666,A cheap lighter I found lying around. It barely[r]has any lighter fluid left.[l][p]

a0_050_0344,Okay. I've had a look around the area.[r]I should head somewhere else now.[l][p]
a0_050_0345,Where to next...[l][p]
a0_050_0346,First, around [c3]Midoricho Park[c0], at the end of South[r]Warigesui Street, is the Taiko of Tsugaru.[l][p]
a0_050_0347,North of there is a school called [c3]Komagata High[r]School[c0] at the location of the Fool's Procession.[l][p]
a0_050_0348,It should be around here...[l][p]
a0_050_0349,<align="center"><color=#ddd><cspace=-2px><font="TELOP">駒形高校正門前[x0.3][r]<cspace=0px><font="MAIN">Komagata High School, Front Gates
a0_050_0350,Here I am at Komagata High School.[l][p]
a0_050_0351,Let's see here...[l][p]
a0_050_0352,Aaah! Someone's there![l][p]
a0_050_0353,Huh?[l][p]
a0_050_0354,Whoa! What the!?[l][p]
a0_050_0355,Ouch...[l][p]
a0_050_0356,I'm so sorry! Are you okay?[l][p]
a0_050_0357,Yeah, I'm fine, but... Did you just climb[r]over the school gate?[l][p]
a0_050_0358,What's going on?[r]Why are you at school this late?[l][p]
a0_050_0359,Um, well...[l][p]
a0_050_0360,I'm really sorry! I'm in a big hurry right now,[r]so I gotta go!
a0_050_0361,Hey, wait![l][p]
a0_050_0362,Huh!?[l][p]
a0_050_0363,Gaaah... A...curse!?[r]Ngh... Gah... Why...?[l][p]
a0_050_0364,It can't... be... Aaagh![r]Mio...I'm.. sorry...![l][p]
a0_050_0365,A girl in a school uniform came climbing over[r]the front gate. She must be a student here.[l][p]
a0_050_0366,Hm...? That thing she's hiding in her hand...[l][p]
a0_050_0367,No doubt about it. That's a curse stone![l][p]
a0_050_0368,This girl is a curse bearer!
a0_050_0369,There's no doubt in my mind that she was holding[r]a curse stone.[l][p]
a0_050_0370,This school is supposedly on the former site[r]of a daimyo's residence where he encountered[r]the Fool's Procession.[l][p]
a0_050_0371,It's now at the center of a quiet residential[r]area.[l][p]
a0_050_0372,There's not a person in sight.[l][p]
a0_050_0373,The school gate is closed, but climbing over[r]looks easy enough.[l][p]
a0_050_0374,Past the gate, I can see the main school[r]building.[l][p]
a0_050_0375,Hm? It's too dark and far away[r]to see clearly, but...[l][p]
a0_050_0376,I think I can almost make out someone inside...[l][p]
a0_050_0377,It's quite suspicious for someone to be here this[r]late at night...[l][p]
a0_050_0378,But waiting here would just be a waste of time.[r]I should come back later.[l][p]
a0_050_0379,I can see the main school building past the gate.[r]Was the girl inside the school?[l][p]
a0_050_0380,The large gymnasium looms silently over the[r]grounds. It doesn't look like anyone is in there.[l][p]
a0_050_0381,The large gymnasium looms silently over the[r]grounds. It's even more imposing in the dark...[l][p]
a0_050_0382,<i>If there's no sign of curse bearers or curse[r]echoes, I should go search a different location.[l][p]
a0_050_0383,<i>Schools sure are spooky at night. Curses aside,[r]something about it just gives me the creeps.[l][p]
a0_050_0384,<i>A student appearing suddenly at the location[r]of the Fool's Procession late at night...[l][p]
a0_050_0385,<i>Clearly something unusual is going on,[r]and it involves the curse. I can't write it off[r]as coincidence.[l][p]
a0_050_0386,That girl... If she's a curse bearer...[l][p]
a0_050_0387,I shouldn't go back to the park where[r]the detectives are. It'd be better to[r]take care of my business here.[l][p]

a0_050_0389,This is Midoricho Park, location of the Taiko of[r]Tsugaru, one of the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
a0_050_0390,Huh!? Someone's there![l][p]
a0_050_0391,Two men... One middle-aged and the other a young[r]adult, talking to each other.[l][p]
a0_050_0392,There's a good chance that one of them could be a[r]curse bearer...[l][p]
a0_050_0393,I'll try to scope things out without being[r]spotted.[l][p]
a0_050_0394,To pick up their conversation from[r]this distance, I'll have to focus in and[r][c3]watch them for a while[c0] I think...[l][p]
a0_050_0395,If it looks like I'll be spotted, I'll quickly[r][c3]hide behind a tree to move out of line of sight[c0].[l][p]
a0_050_0396,<i>...I should be okay.[r]Now to listen to the rest of their conversation.[l][p]
a0_050_0397,<i>No good. I can't see what they're doing[r]if I stay hidden like this.[l][p]
a0_050_0398,[s0][a0.5]"Huh. They were supposed to be around here, but[r]I don't see anyone, Boss."
a0_050_0399,[s0][a0.5]"No need to get ahead of ourselves.[r]I bet we see something before the night is done."
a0_050_0400,[s0][a0.5]"Maybe you're right...[r]But still, the Seven Mysteries—"
a0_050_0401,[s0][a0.5]"...Huh? Was there a noise from[r]behind us just now?"
a0_050_0402,[s0][a0.5]"Hmm... Never mind. Just my imagination."
a0_050_0403,[s0][a0.5]"...But does the curse really let you kill[r]someone with an object like that?"
a0_050_0404,[s0][a0.5]"Hm...? Sorry, something's bugging me,[r]I'm gonna have a check back there."
a0_050_0405,[s0][a0.5]"Huh, nothing. I guess this place is just[r]keeping me on edge."
a0_050_0406,Hey! Who's there![l][p]
a0_050_0407,Urk...![l][p]
a0_050_0408,Ah-ha! Sorry, sir.[r]Would you mind if we asked you a few questions?[l][p]
a0_050_0409,Ngh! They found me![l][p]
a0_050_0410,Oh, you two are police officers...[l][p]
a0_050_0411,Haha! People often say we don't look it.[r]Sorry if we startled you.[l][p]
a0_050_0412,I'm sure there's no problem, but we'll have to[r]ask you some questions, as procedure.[l][p]
a0_050_0413,Oh, I'm [c4]Jun Erio[c0]. I'm from the Metropolitan[r]Police Department, Investigative Division.[l][p]

a0_050_0417,You wouldn't guess from that frown,[r]but he actually has quite the sweet tooth...[l][p]

a0_050_0422,Hm? We're done here. Go on home.[l][p]
a0_050_0423,He's as intimidating as I'd expect[r]a veteran cop to be.[l][p]
a0_050_0424,First that private detective, now police[r]detectives. Why today of all days?[l][p]
a0_050_0425,Now first, can you show me some ID with your[r]name, address, and occupation?[l][p]
a0_050_0426,...[l][p]
a0_050_0427,I'll be okay. I'm better off just[r]going along with it.[l][p]
a0_050_0428,Wow, you work for Hihaku Soaps? I hear they've[r]been raking it in lately, that true?[l][p]
a0_050_0429,I don't know much about that. I'm just a recent[r]hire.[l][p]
a0_050_0430,People are loving that new hair product you have.[r]I use it all the time, myself.[l][p]
a0_050_0431,...Thank you for your patronage.[l][p]
a0_050_0432,Erio, you use hair products...?[l][p]
a0_050_0433,Get with the times, Boss! Guys nowadays all use[r]these things![l][p]
a0_050_0434,Isn't that right, Mr. Okiie?[l][p]
a0_050_0435,Uh... Yeah. Sure.[r]We even make men's cosmetics now.[l][p]
a0_050_0436,That so? What a time we live in...[l][p]
a0_050_0437,Sorry. Boss is the kind of caveman who thinks[r]using only a bar of soap for all his washing makes[r]him cool or something.[l][p]
a0_050_0438,I don't think that. I just don't care enough to[r]use anything else.[l][p]
a0_050_0439,Actually, we do have all-in-one soaps for just[r]that purpose. There are plenty of people like you.[l][p]
a0_050_0440,Ha! Hear that, Erio? That's what I'm talking[r]about. You should put out more of those.[l][p]
a0_050_0441,Aren‘t you riled up?[l][p]
a0_050_0442,Anyway, Mr. Okiie, what is it[r]that you're doing here?[l][p]
a0_050_0443,Um, actually...[l][p]
a0_050_0444,I'm searching for the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
a0_050_0445,Have you heard of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo,[r]Detective?[l][p]
a0_050_0446,Yeah, yeah! I've heard of them. We were just[r]talking about them a minute ago.[l][p]
a0_050_0447,A girl I know is into them. That's how I got interested.[l][p]
a0_050_0448,I see. I seem to remember even Midoricho Park had[r]one of the Mysteries associated with it. What[r]was it again...?[l][p]
a0_050_0449,...Huh? Are you sure about that?[l][p]
a0_050_0450,No, it's the Taiko of Tsugaru.[r]This whole area used to be the residence of[r]the Tsugaru, a clan of samurai.[l][p]
a0_050_0451,Are you sure you're really interested in the[r]Seven Mysteries?[l][p]
a0_050_0452,Urk... Sorry, there's so much to remember,[r]I got a little mixed up.[l][p]
a0_050_0453,Come on now, Boss. It's not like this is[r]an interrogation.[l][p]
a0_050_0454,Ah, that's right! The Taiko of Tsugaru![r]This whole area used to be the residence of[r]the Tsugaru, a clan of samurai.[l][p]
a0_050_0455,...So that's why you were hanging around in the[r]middle of the night.[l][p]
a0_050_0456,Discover anything interesting?[l][p]
a0_050_0457,No, nothing. Though I admit I haven't been looking[r]into these things too hard.[l][p]
a0_050_0458,Right... I think I understand your situation.[l][p]
a0_050_0459,Thank you for your answers. Now it's quite late,[r]so you'd best be heading home.[l][p]
a0_050_0460,Hm? Something wrong? You're free to go.[l][p]
a0_050_0461,...[l][p]
a0_050_0462,<i>The detectives show no sign of leaving.[r]I don't have conclusive proof that they're[r]curse bearers, either.[l][p]
a0_050_0463,<i>The risk is too high for me to stick around[r]talking with them for long.[l][p]
a0_050_0464,Um, excuse me...[l][p]
a0_050_0465,Since you detectives are around, does that mean[r]something happened around here?[l][p]
a0_050_0466,Heheh. Well, we are investigators, so it is[r]indeed related to a case.[l][p]
a0_050_0467,But don't worry. There's no threat[r]to civilians whatsoever.[l][p]
a0_050_0468,We'll be here a while longer looking into[r]things, but you can rest easy.[l][p]
a0_050_0469,<i>...[l][p]
a0_050_0470,<i>A while longer, huh. That's not good.[r]This may be my only chance.[l][p]
a0_050_0471,I see... Well, I'll be going now.[l][p]
a0_050_0472,Take care.[l][p]
a0_050_0473,It's late out. Make sure you get home safely.[l][p]
a0_050_0474,I always imagine detectives as blunt[r]and aggressive, but I guess there are some[r]pleasant ones too.[l][p]
a0_050_0475,<i>Uh oh, they're detectives. They're not[r]investigating the corpse that was here, are they?[l][p]
a0_050_0476,<i>No, I'm still fine anyway.[r]It's not like a curse could show up as evidence[r]in a police investigation.[l][p]

a0_060_0651,Heya. Quick question for you.[l][p]
a0_060_0652,What the...[l][p]
a0_060_0653,Sorry this is so sudden, but I've gotta ask.[r]You don't mind, do you?[l][p]
a0_060_0654,Are you a curse bearer?
a0_060_0655,...What?[l][p]
a0_060_0656,Ngh...![l][p]
a0_060_0657,Making it obvious that he's a curse bearer[r]himself—what's he trying to pull?[l][p]
a0_060_0658,Maybe he's confident that he can activate his[r]curse before I activate mine... Gotta be careful.[l][p]
a0_060_0659,How should I respond here...?[l][p]
a0_060_0660,Yeah. I'm a curse bearer too.[l][p]
a0_060_0661,...The hell is that?[l][p]
a0_060_0662,You took too long to answer.[l][p]
a0_060_0663,Huh!?[l][p]
a0_060_0664,Plus, you glanced behind me when the curse echo[r]appeared.[l][p]
a0_060_0665,I knew it. You're a curse bearer, too. You can[r]stop trying to hide it now. Not that you were[r]doing a very good job...[l][p]
a0_060_0666,Damn it...![l][p]
a0_060_0667,...Yeah. You're right.[l][p]
a0_060_0668,I appreciate the honesty. I just want to have a[r]nice, calm little chat.[l][p]
a0_060_0669,The name's [c4]Yutaro Namigaki[c0].[r]My curse echo is the Foot-Washing Mansion.[l][p]

a0_060_0672,A chat?[l][p]
a0_060_0673,I'm not going to curse first and ask questions[r]later just because we're both curse bearers.[r]I've got a little more class than that.[l][p]
a0_060_0674,I hope you're smart enough to extend me the[r]same courtesy.[l][p]
a0_060_0675,...Fine. Chat away.[l][p]
a0_060_0676,Thank you. Good to know I'm dealing with[r]someone reasonable.[l][p]
a0_060_0677,...[l][p]
a0_060_0678,Oh? I didn't hear your answer.[l][p]
a0_060_0679,You aren't thinking about whether you can set off[r]your curse before I can activate mine, now are you?[l][p]
a0_060_0680,Ngh...![l][p]
a0_060_0681,What the...! How did you...?[l][p]
a0_060_0682,Oh, don't mind me.[l][p]
a0_060_0683,Yutaro said he wants to talk. You'd better answer[r]quickly before... Well, you know what.[l][p]
a0_060_0684,Is this his curse echo?[l][p]
a0_060_0685,He said it was the Foot-Washing Mansion...[r]Is that why there are only legs?[l][p]
a0_060_0686,All right, let's talk. What do you want?[l][p]
a0_060_0687,Right. I'll cut straight to the chase.[l][p]
a0_060_0688,Will you...join forces with me?[l][p]
a0_060_0689,Join forces...? To gather soul dregs?[l][p]
a0_060_0690,Yep. You're using your curse because there's[r]someone you want to resurrect too, right?[l][p]
a0_060_0691,In that case, it'd be more effective for the two[r]of us to work together than to do it all yourself.[l][p]
a0_060_0692,Think about it. We could split the work, and we'd[r]have two kinds of curses at our disposal.[l][p]
a0_060_0693,Working together...[r]I hadn't thought about that before.[l][p]
a0_060_0694,Can the soul dregs in one curse stone be moved[r]to another? That's a fundamental requirement for[r]this to work.[l][p]
a0_060_0695,Well, we'll have to test it. And I can't do that[r]alone, either.[l][p]
a0_060_0696,I see...[l][p]
a0_060_0697,All right, then. If working together helps us both[r]get what we want, maybe it's not a bad idea.[l][p]
a0_060_0698,Thanks. Glad to be dealing with someone who can[r]think things through rationally.[l][p]
a0_060_0699,But there's something I need to know in advance.[l][p]
a0_060_0700,Tell me...[l][p]
a0_060_0701,How many soul dregs do you have right now?[l][p]
a0_060_0702,...[l][p]
a0_060_0703,Right. I have...some, of course. I am more than[r]competent, after all.[l][p]
a0_060_0704,I'm asking you how many.[l][p]
a0_060_0705,...[l][p]
a0_060_0706,I'm at 1%...but don't worry about it. My curse[r]is so easy to activate I'll have plenty in no time.[l][p]
a0_060_0707,I bet you haven't managed to get any on your own,[r]have you?[l][p]
a0_060_0708,Sorry, but there's no way I can accept your offer[r]until I know that.[l][p]
a0_060_0709,Who's to say you won't run away while we're in[r]the middle of testing it?[l][p]
a0_060_0710,...[l][p]
a0_060_0711,Well, you're just going to have to trust me.[r]Or do you think you can collect them all yourself?[l][p]
a0_060_0712,I'm at [$102]%.[l][p]
a0_060_0713,Huh? Say what?[l][p]
a0_060_0714,That's the amount of soul dregs I have in my[r]curse stone right now.[l][p]
a0_060_0715,What!?[l][p]
a0_060_0716,Wait, are you serious!?[l][p]
a0_060_0717,You're not even close to being on my level.[l][p]
a0_060_0718,I'll keep gathering soul dregs on my own.[r]Let's forget all this joining forces business.[l][p]
a0_060_0719,You've gotta be kidding me![l][p]
a0_060_0720,...Hmph. I call your bluff.[r]Don't think you can scare me off so easily.[l][p]
a0_060_0721,A young man, probably younger than me.[r]Maybe a college student?[l][p]
a0_060_0722,This guy is quite the bold character.[r]He's got confidence, I'll give him that.[l][p]
a0_060_0723,The canal where the One-Sided Reed grew is[r]supposed to be around here somewhere...[l][p]
a0_060_0724,But now there's no trace of it left.[l][p]
a0_060_0725,The large bridge here is called [c4]Ryogoku Bridge[c0].[l][p]
a0_060_0726,Crossing the river leads to Nihonbashi Bakurocho[r]in Chuo City.[l][p]
a0_060_0727,<i>Why would he out himself as a curse bearer[r]like that...?[l][p]
a0_060_0728,<i>Don't tell me it has something to do with[r]activating his curse?[l][p]
a0_060_0729,<i>Whoa! There's a woman behind him![l][p]
a0_060_0730,<i>What does she have to do with this?[r]Are the two of them gathering soul dregs together?[l][p]
a0_060_0731,<i>A chat between two curse bearers?[r]What's he trying to pull?[l][p]
a0_060_0732,I don't think that's a good idea. If I don't[r]make a clean escape, it might cost me my life.[l][p]
a0_060_0733,Besides, I might still be able to take soul dregs[r]from him...![l][p]
a0_060_0734,I see... That's too bad.[l][p]
a0_060_0735,If you don't feel like talking, then you leave me[r]no choice.[l][p]
a0_060_0736,I even gave you a chance to come out of this[r]alive. Real shame you're just gonna waste it.[l][p]
a0_060_0737,What are you...!?[l][p]
a0_060_0738,What the...? Is this the voice of the curse echo?[l][p]
a0_060_0739,Among the Seven Mysteries, the resentful memory[r]of the Foot-Washing Mansion is particularly strong.[l][p]
a0_060_0740,You can't block it out by plugging your ears.[r]As soon as you hear the voice of my curse echo,[r]it's the end for you![l][p]

a0_060_0743,My, my, [%0]... You seem to have arrived at a[r]less-than-favorable result.[l][p]
a0_060_0744,This is mere conjecture on my part, but...[l][p]
a0_060_0745,You have a way to evade curses that no one else[r]is capable of, do you not?[l][p]
a0_060_0746,However... As you've been here several times,[r]allow me to expound on this further.[l][p]
a0_060_0747,If I'm not mistaken, you've already learned[r][c3]how to avoid hearing the voice[c0] of the curse[r]echo somewhere.[l][p]
a0_060_0748,If by chance you've forgotten, perhaps try[r]rereading [c3]How to Play[c0] in your Files.[l][p]
a0_060_0749,Fear not. You may make as many attempts as you[r]please from the conversation with Yutaro.[l][p]
a0_060_0750,Very well. Remember to ward off the curse before[r]it is activated.[l][p]
a0_060_0751,But bear in mind, Shogo Okiie has no way of[r]realizing it himself, so you must react for him.[l][p]
a0_060_0752,Hm...?[l][p]

a0_060_0754,What!? There's no way...![l][p]

a0_060_0757,...[l][p]
a0_060_0758,I don't completely understand it myself, but his[r]curse's conditions don't seem to have been met.[l][p]

a0_060_0772,However...[l][p]
a0_060_0773,...[$62].[l][p]

a0_060_0779,...[l][p]
a0_060_0780,<i>...Yeah.[l][p]
a0_060_0781,<i>As soon as I snuck into the gardens...[l][p]
a0_060_0782,<i>A woman inside called out from behind me.[l][p]
a0_060_0783,[s0][a0.5]"I've been waiting for you.[r]...I have a curse stone."

a0_060_0785,[s0][a0.5]"I have you in a position where I can use my[r]curse on you whenever I please."
a0_060_0786,[s0][a0.5]"If you hand over your curse stone, I will at[r]least spare your life."
a0_060_0787,<i>In that moment, all I could squeeze out in[r]reply was, "Let me think about it."[l][p]
a0_060_0788,...Which brings us to now.[l][p]
a0_060_0789,All right...[l][p]
a0_060_0790,Don't tell me you still haven't made up your mind?[l][p]
a0_060_0791,Such an indecisive man.[l][p]
a0_060_0792,Wait, umm...[l][p]
a0_060_0793,I might hand over my curse stone, depending on[r]certain things. Will you hear me out for a moment?[l][p]
a0_060_0794,...[l][p]
a0_060_0795,Sure. Go on.[l][p]
a0_060_0796,If you take my curse stone, what are you going[r]to do with it?[l][p]
a0_060_0797,With your curse stone?[l][p]
a0_060_0798,It's brimming with soul dregs, isn't it?[l][p]
a0_060_0799,It's already killed so many, no?[l][p]
a0_060_0800,...![l][p][l][p]
a0_060_0801,<i>How does she know so much!?[l][p]
a0_060_0802,I'd like to avoid such...crude methods myself.[l][p]
a0_060_0803,Can you take soul dregs from other curse bearers'[r]stones and add them to your own?[l][p]
a0_060_0804,Who knows...?[l][p]
a0_060_0805,But...[l][p]
a0_060_0806,You have to admit...it's worth trying.[l][p]
a0_060_0807,So basically...[l][p]
a0_060_0808,You want soul dregs, but you steal the ones[r]others have gathered because you don't want to[r]get your own hands dirty?[l][p]
a0_060_0809,You're half right.[l][p]
a0_060_0810,But half wrong, too.[l][p]
a0_060_0811,...?[l][p]
a0_060_0812,I don't mind getting my hands dirty.[l][p]
a0_060_0813,I just want to end this with as little trouble[r]as possible.[l][p]
a0_060_0814,Understand?[l][p]
a0_060_0815,...[l][p]
a0_060_0816,How do you know you haven't already set off[r]my curse?[l][p]
a0_060_0817,Go on, then. Use it.[l][p]
a0_060_0818,...[l][p]
a0_060_0819,If I had, you could have activated it without[r]all that bluster.[l][p]
a0_060_0820,And yet...here you are.[l][p]
a0_060_0821,...![l][p]
a0_060_0822,<i>Damn, does she already know about it!?[r]Or about that student from before...!?[l][p]
a0_060_0823,<i>But if she already knows what would activate it,[r]she wouldn't hide it.[l][p]
a0_060_0824,<i>Because if you know what activates my curse,[r]there's no way you would set it off yourself.[l][p]
a0_060_0825,<i>So she must not know yet.[r]...I still have a chance.[l][p]
a0_060_0826,...Listen.[l][p]

a0_060_0828,About what?[l][p]
a0_060_0829,Talking like this instead of killing you[r]immediately...[l][p]
a0_060_0830,It's just a whim of mine.[l][p]
a0_060_0831,What I mean to say is that you were never in a[r]position to bargain.[l][p]
a0_060_0832,...![l][p][l][p]
a0_060_0833,...You actually can't kill me, can you?[l][p]
a0_060_0834,And that strange countdown from before, too...[l][p]
a0_060_0835,It's all just a bluff to threaten me.[l][p]
a0_060_0836,...[l][p]
a0_060_0837,I don't give in to threats. So why don't you[r]give this up and—[l][p]
a0_060_0838,If that's the case...[l][p]
a0_060_0839,Give it a try, then.[l][p]
a0_060_0840,Only [$62] more, now.[l][p]
a0_060_0841,Let me tell you the number.[l][p]
a0_060_0842,...[l][p]
a0_060_0843,This conversation...[l][p]
a0_060_0844,is over.[l][p]
a0_060_0845,You want soul dregs... That means you're after[r]the Rite of Resurrection, too.[l][p]
a0_060_0846,Not that I'm trying to compare our circumstances,[r]but can I ask what led you to this?[l][p]
a0_060_0847,Oh my...[l][p]
a0_060_0848,Do you mean that if my situation is more dire[r]than yours...[l][p]
a0_060_0849,You'd give your curse stone to me?[l][p]
a0_060_0850,Sure, I'd consider it. So tell me...[l][p]
a0_060_0851,Liar.[l][p]
a0_060_0852,...Huh?[l][p]
a0_060_0853,You wouldn't hang your fate on something as[r]superficial as that.[l][p]
a0_060_0854,Nor would I.[l][p]
a0_060_0855,...[l][p]
a0_060_0856,...My son.[l][p]
a0_060_0857,Wha...[l][p]
a0_060_0858,He'd be in sixth grade now.[l][p]
a0_060_0859,...If he were still alive.[l][p]
a0_060_0860,Ah...[l][p]
a0_060_0861,"When I'm one of the big kids, I'll help look[r]after the first and second graders," he'd say...[l][p]
a0_060_0862,He always had a strong sense of justice[r]and responsibility.[l][p]
a0_060_0863,...[l][p]
a0_060_0864,He wouldn't stand by when he saw other kids[r]being bullied.[l][p]
a0_060_0865,He'd defend them, even if he was no match for[r]the bully himself.[l][p]
a0_060_0866,He'd often come home in tears...[l][p]
a0_060_0867,But only because he was sad that he wasn't[r]strong enough to save others.[l][p]
a0_060_0868,He wanted to be a policeman when he grew up...[l][p]
a0_060_0869,Okay, okay, I get it.[l][p]
a0_060_0870,I've heard enough.[l][p]
a0_060_0871,...Oh. That's enough for you?[l][p]
a0_060_0872,Yeah.[l][p]
a0_060_0873,Hearing such a sad story...[l][p]
a0_060_0874,just makes me all the more sorry that I haven't[r]changed my mind.[l][p]
a0_060_0875,I see. Heh...[l][p]
a0_060_0876,So even after what I told you...[l][p]
a0_060_0877,You still won't hand it over.[l][p]
a0_060_0878,If we're going to talk, we should get to know[r]each other better.[l][p]
a0_060_0879,My name is Shogo—
a0_060_0880,Stop.[l][p]
a0_060_0881,Huh...?[l][p]
a0_060_0882,Let's not do that, all right?[l][p]
a0_060_0883,If I know your name, I might start to feel sorry[r]for you.[l][p]
a0_060_0884,...And have a harder time killing you.[l][p]
a0_060_0885,Y-you would?[l][p]
a0_060_0886,Don't you think?[l][p]
a0_060_0887,Well, what if you just tell me your name?[l][p]
a0_060_0888,...[l][p]
a0_060_0889,Why?[l][p]
a0_060_0890,Well... I need to call you something.[l][p]
a0_060_0891,Then call me ma'am.[l][p]
a0_060_0892,Huh...?[l][p]
a0_060_0893,Um, all right. ...Ma'am.[l][p]
a0_060_0894,Yes? What is it?[l][p]
a0_060_0895,<i>Urgh. This is bad.[r]She's completely running the show here.[l][p]
a0_060_0896,I've had enough.[l][p]
a0_060_0897,Two curse bearers...[l][p]
a0_060_0898,shouldn't be carrying on like this.[l][p]
a0_060_0899,It feels weird being in these magnificent gardens[r]after hours. There's not a visitor or[r]groundskeeper in sight.[l][p]
a0_060_0900,The Ryogoku Public Hall is also on the grounds.[r]Its eye-catching structure makes this place feel[r]even more otherworldly.[l][p]
a0_060_0901,A woman in her thirties.[r]She has a refined air about her, like she was[r]brought up in a family of high social standing.[l][p]
a0_060_0902,But I also sense a shadow hanging over her...[r]I wonder if it has to do with this place?[l][p]
a0_060_0903,<i>The question is...what do I do about this?[l][p]
a0_060_0904,<i>Damn it... Did I expose myself somehow?[l][p]
a0_060_0905,<i>She said she can use her curse on me anytime.[r]I guess I've already fulfilled its conditions.[l][p]
a0_060_0906,<i>It could be a bluff, but since she seems to have[r]information on me, it's probably true.[l][p]
a0_060_0907,<i>I can't hand over my curse stone.[r]I need to figure out how her curse is activated[r]and find a way out of here.[l][p]
a0_060_0908,<i>For now, maybe I can get some information by[r]talking about something that'd catch her interest.[l][p]
a0_060_0909,<i>What condition have I fulfilled since the moment[r]I stepped foot in here?[l][p]
a0_060_0910,<i>Something that I'm still doing even now...[l][p]
a0_060_0911,<i>Think, what could it be?[l][p]
a0_060_0912,<i>Maybe...something I have on me?[l][p]
a0_060_0913,<i>If I suddenly stripped naked on the spot, I just[r]might be able to avoid her curse.[l][p]
a0_060_0914,<i>...No. That would take too long. She'd probably[r]kill me before I even got my shirt off.[l][p]
a0_060_0915,<i>Plus...I'd look like a creep.[l][p]
a0_060_0916,<i>The other possibility is that the condition[r]has to do with the location we're in.[l][p]
a0_060_0917,<i>If being here is what activates the curse of[r]the Evergreen Beech...[l][p]
a0_060_0918,<i>Then I'll continue to meet that condition as long[r]as I'm here.[l][p]
a0_060_0919,<i>In which case there's no escape. She'd activate[r]her curse before I ever got away from the gardens.[l][p]
a0_060_0920,<i>I'm sure I'd recognize it after setting it off,[r]but it's not like I'd get to do things over...[l][p]
a0_060_0921,<i>So if I can't figure out her curse...[r]I'll have to set off my own.[l][p]
a0_060_0922,<i>I don't see how I could make her leave, though.[r]Not while she has the upper hand.[l][p]
a0_060_0923,All I can think of is to make her use her curse...[r]Damn it![l][p]
a0_060_0924,But there's no way I could counterattack after[r]she curses me...[l][p]
a0_060_0925,...Such a shame.[l][p]
a0_060_0926,...What?[l][p]
a0_060_0927,This is the end for you.[l][p]
a0_060_0928,Farewell.[l][p]
a0_060_0929,No...![l][p]
a0_060_0930,Aaaaaaggghhh![r]Fire!? Fire...! It's so hot! It...it burns...![l][p]
a0_060_0931,Fire? Fire...!? Aaaugh, of course![r]That's what it was...![l][p]
a0_060_0932,Aaaaaagh![l][p]
a0_060_0933,That guy... Damn it...![r]He...must've been...following me...![l][p]
a0_060_0934,But it's...already...[r]too...late......
a0_060_0935,My, my, [%0]... You seem to have arrived at a[r]less-than-favorable result.[l][p]
a0_060_0936,It was not all in vain, however, as you've[r]finally realized how the curse is activated.[l][p]
a0_060_0937,Ah, perhaps I should explain further.[l][p]
a0_060_0938,Perhaps Shogo Okiie's fatal error was carrying[r]something that could be a source of flame.[l][p]
a0_060_0939,Fear not. You may make as many attempts as you[r]please from the conversation with the lady.[l][p]
a0_060_0940,Very well. Remember how to ward off the curse[r]when you return.[l][p]
a0_060_0941,But bear in mind, Shogo Okiie has no way of[r]realizing it himself, so you must react for him.[l][p]
a0_060_0942,...Not sure why, but here goes nothing![l][p]
a0_060_0943,Hm?[l][p]
a0_060_0944,What did you just...?[l][p]
a0_060_0945,Why? Why throw your lighter away all of a sudden?[l][p]
a0_060_0946,Huh?[l][p]
a0_060_0947,Uh, well... I just kind of felt like it...[l][p]
a0_060_0948,Ah... Aaah... How...?[l][p]
a0_060_0949,Why is she losing it all of a sudden?[l][p]
a0_060_0950,Could that lighter have been what fulfilled the[r]condition of her curse?[l][p]
a0_060_0951,But...why? How did I...?[l][p]
a0_060_0952,Ngh, how could you...![l][p]
a0_060_0953,Ah...![l][p]
a0_060_0954,Aaaaaah![l][p]
a0_060_0955,Gaaah! Ungh...![r]This can't be! Aaah, my Shu...ichi...![l][p]
a0_060_0956,Haah, haah...[l][p]
a0_060_0957,Whew. That was too close for comfort.[l][p]
a0_060_0958,Was that just coincidence? Not only was I able[r]to release myself from her curse...[l][p]
a0_060_0959,She immediately panicked and ran away,[r]fortunately for me.[l][p]
a0_060_0960,If she'd kept her cool and stayed, we would've[r]been at a stalemate.[l][p]
a0_060_0961,Thank god. And now I've gotten the last of the[r]soul dregs I need![l][p]
a0_060_0962,Was that just coincidence? He wasn't able to[r]activate his curse for some reason.[l][p]
a0_060_0963,Things are going well! Luck must be on my side![l][p]
a0_060_0964,Oh, I should check my curse stone.[r]It should have gained a lot just now![l][p]
a0_060_0965,What the...!?[l][p]
a0_060_0966,Aaaaaagh![l][p]
a0_060_0967,Pardon the interruption, but I'd like to take[r]this chance to tell you about the Story Chart.[l][p]
a0_060_0968,This is the screen which will appear when you[r]open the Story Chart.[l][p]
a0_060_0969,From here, not only can you see the overall[r]structure of the current story...[l][p]
a0_060_0970,you can also progress along different branching[r]routes by playing past stories over again.[l][p]
a0_060_0971,We could call this exactly the power that[r]Shogo Okiie had sought after.[l][p]
a0_060_0972,Normally you would have been able to use the[r]Story Chart feature freely...[l][p]
a0_060_0973,However, due to certain circumstances, it has[r]been locked until now.[l][p]
a0_060_0974,From here on, you will return to the Story Chart[r]from time to time at breaks in the story.[l][p]
a0_060_0975,At those times, you will choose for yourself[r]which story you wish to continue next.[l][p]
a0_060_0976,By the way...[l][p]
a0_060_0977,Should you use the Story Chart to replay[r]a past event...[l][p]
a0_060_0978,Do you know what you must do, and where?[l][p]
a0_060_0979,...Of course you do.[r]After all, you have gotten this far.[l][p]
a0_060_0980,What trigger did Yoko Fukunaga set off that[r]led to her dying the way she did?[l][p]
a0_060_0981,You've come this far several times, so I have[r]every confidence you will be all right.[l][p]
a0_060_0982,As long as you make sure not to do that thing.[l][p]
a0_060_0983,However, like with the lighter and voice earlier,[r]Shogo Okiie has no way of knowing that himself.[l][p]
a0_060_0984,Ah. On that note, I am curious...[l][p]
a0_060_0985,Have you determined how many people Shogo Okiie[r]has killed with his curse?
a0_060_0986,Heheheh. I see, I see.[l][p]
a0_060_0987,So that is your understanding of things.[l][p]
a0_060_0988,As it turns out, the correct answer is...[l][p]
a0_060_0989,[$71].[l][p]
a0_060_0990,Aha! That is correct! I am pleased to see you[r]have such a solid grasp of events.[l][p]
a0_060_0991,...I think you will be just fine.[l][p]
a0_060_0992,Well... That is all.[l][p]
a0_060_0993,Please continue the story at your leisure[r]from the Story Chart screen.[l][p]
a0_060_0994,The curse stone of the Whispering Canal,[r]one of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo.[r]It is currently [$102]% filled with soul dregs.[l][p]
a0_060_0995,The 100-yen lighter that saved my life.[r]It still has a tiny bit of fuel left.[l][p]
a0_060_0996,The 100-yen lighter that saved my life.[r]It still has a tiny bit of fuel left.
a0_060_0997,Huh...?[l][p]
a0_060_0998,Throw away...this lighter?[r]Why did I suddenly get the impulse to do that?

a0_110_0064,Wh-what...? I... Um...[l][p]
a0_110_0065,Are you okay? You were so rattled and confused[r]I thought you'd really lost it.[l][p]
a0_110_0066,Do you feel dizzy? Have a headache?[r]Are your humors off-balance?[l][p]
a0_110_0067,...Wait, what did you say?[r]I think I've heard that before.[l][p]
a0_110_0068,You're the one who said it earlier.[l][p]

a0_110_0071,Yeah... I've heard that at this age, your humors[r]being even a little bit off can be fatal![l][p]
a0_110_0072,...[l][p]

a0_110_0074,Yeah. I'm sorry... I didn't mean to cause you[r]so much trouble.[l][p]
a0_110_0075,But...I really don't remember what happened.[l][p]
a0_110_0076,Hmm... Sounds like what happened to me.[r]Maybe this place is dangerous somehow?[l][p]
a0_110_0077,Whaaat!? Are you backing out!?[l][p]
a0_110_0078,Yeah. It just doesn't feel safe to me, and I'm[r]worried about you.[l][p]

a0_110_0080,Come on![r]I just started feeling back to normal, too...[l][p]
a0_110_0081,Nope. Not happening. Go home.[r]I'll even pay your cab fare, okay?[l][p]
a0_110_0082,...I ended up having to force a still protesting[r]Yoko into a taxi.[l][p]
a0_110_0083,Even then, she still wouldn't stop complaining...[l][p]

a0_120_0043,In further news…
a0_120_0044,Before dawn today, a police officer on patrol[r]discovered a man collapsed in a Sumida City park.
a0_120_0045,The man was taken to the hospital, but his death[r]was confirmed shortly after.
a0_120_0046,Investigations are still underway, but police[r]suspect a connection to the other unexplained[r]deaths found in the area at around the same time.
a0_120_0047,Well done in your efforts thus far.[l][p]
a0_120_0048,This brings Shogo Okiie's story to a close.[l][p]
a0_120_0049,Ah, but this is not the end. Far from it.[r]In fact, this is where the story finally begins.[l][p]
a0_120_0050,The routes of the three protagonists have now[r]been unlocked.[l][p]
a0_120_0051,[c4]Harue Shigima[c0], a woman who lost her son when[r]he was kidnapped and murdered.[l][p]
a0_120_0052,[c4]Tetsuo Tsutsumi[c0], the chief inspector of the[r]First Investigative Division, who is looking into[r]the death of an officer in the line of duty.[l][p]
a0_120_0053,[c4]Yakko Sakazaki[c0], a high school girl who wants to[r]bring her friend back from the dead—a girl who[r]died in a suspicious suicide.[l][p]

b0_010_0741,Back with me, ma'am?[l][p]
b0_010_0742,Can't say I understand what just happened...[l][p]
b0_010_0743,but it certainly seems to have put you in a[r]good mood.[l][p]
b0_010_0744,This might be the first time I've ever seen[r]you really smile.[l][p]
b0_010_0745,Sweet dreams?[l][p]

b0_010_0748,No.[l][p]
b0_010_0749,Not dreams.[l][p]
b0_010_0750,Sounds like something I might want to hear about.[l][p]
b0_010_0751,<i>...[l][p]
b0_010_0752,<i>...My heart's still racing.[l][p]
b0_010_0753,<i>This is it. My chance. At long last...[l][p]
b0_010_0754,The swinging of the pendulum echoes through[r]the room.[l][p]
b0_010_0755,It feels livelier than usual with Richter here.[r]Usually, it's just me.[l][p]
b0_010_0756,The telephone.[l][p]
b0_010_0757,This mansion has a private line.[l][p]
b0_010_0758,A fax machine. It can send images to other[r]places along the telephone network.[l][p]
b0_010_0759,I don't really know how it works.[r]Most houses don't have one.[l][p]
b0_010_0760,I rarely find a use for it.[l][p]
b0_010_0761,An old hanging scroll.[l][p]
b0_010_0762,I don't know who painted it. It's been hanging[r]here since before I was born.[l][p]
b0_010_0763,A stereo unit with separated speakers[r]designed for home use.[l][p]
b0_010_0764,My husband insisted on buying one, even[r]though he isn't one to listen to music often.[l][p]
b0_010_0765,A color television.[l][p]
b0_010_0766,Father bought one as soon as it hit[r]the market. He likes to have the[r]latest gadgets.[l][p]
b0_010_0767,Unlike the latest models, there is no[r]remote control. We've had it for a long time.[l][p]
b0_010_0768,Back when it was new, we all gathered around it[r]and marveled at it as a family...[l][p]
b0_010_0769,but with Father and my husband being away so[r]often, it quickly fell into disuse.[l][p]
b0_010_0770,The lights.[l][p]
b0_010_0771,The chandelier is the only thing in here that's[r]my choice. It's my favorite part of the room.[l][p]
b0_010_0772,The guest table.[l][p]
b0_010_0773,I don't know where Father got this old[r]thing from, but I've never liked it.[l][p]
b0_010_0774,A private investigator I hired.[l][p]
b0_010_0775,A friend told me about him. They said he's not[r]very well known, but he's good at what he does.[l][p]
b0_010_0776,When I first visited his office in Ota City[r]and saw how he dressed, I could hardly believe[r]he was a detective.[l][p]
b0_010_0777,But after talking to him for a while,[r]I changed my mind.[l][p]
b0_010_0778,He says some strange things at times, but[r]he seems like the reliable sort.[l][p]
b0_010_0779,An arrangement of flowers.[l][p]
b0_010_0780,We bring in someone to do it.[r]I don't even know what the flowers are called.[l][p]
b0_010_0781,Well, I'll be damned! Is that what I think it is!?[l][p]
b0_010_0782,Goodness. You made me jump...[l][p]
b0_010_0783,It's just a silly little sticker my son got[r]from somewhere or other.[l][p]
b0_010_0784,He put it up just before... Well, you know what[r]happened. I still can't bring myself[r]to take it down.[l][p]
b0_010_0785,Let me take a closer look...[l][p]
b0_010_0786,I knew it! It's [c4]Head Hencho[c0] from way back[r]in set #1! This is a real collector's item![l][p]
b0_010_0787,...Excuse me?[l][p]
b0_010_0788,Don't tell me you've never heard of the[r][c4]Mocking Birds[c0]?[l][p]
b0_010_0789,The what?[l][p]
b0_010_0790,They're the hottest new craze. Cute little birds[r]dressed up like rough-and-tumble delinquents.[l][p]
b0_010_0791,I've never heard of them...but this certainly[r]seems to matter to you.[l][p]
b0_010_0792,The best part is, nobody knows who made them.[r]They just started showing up around town,[r]and soon enough, they'd won everybody's hearts.[l][p]
b0_010_0793,The story goes that they're made by some[r]anonymous artist who covertly leaves them[r]behind in specific locations.[l][p]
b0_010_0794,No one knows when or where they'll show up next.[r]They're basically an urban legend of sorts.[l][p]
b0_010_0795,To think one would turn up here of all places![r]This is a good sign, I'm sure of it![l][p]
b0_010_0796,Oh. Well, that's...nice.[l][p]
b0_010_0797,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori01 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #1[c0] discovered!
b0_010_0798,Let me bring you up to speed.[l][p]
b0_010_0799,We were in the middle of a chat when you[r]suddenly started spacing out.[l][p]
b0_010_0800,And the whole time, you were grinning to[r]yourself like you'd just won the lottery.[l][p]
b0_010_0801,Care to tell me what that was all about?[l][p]
b0_010_0802,Well... Where to start...[l][p]
b0_010_0803,Hmm. Interesting. Very interesting.[l][p]
b0_010_0804,So, the Haunting Clappers' curse echo appeared[r]out of nowhere...[l][p]
b0_010_0805,told you how to perform the Rite of Resurrection,[r]and gave you the curse you'll need to do it.[l][p]
b0_010_0806,Have I got that right?[l][p]
b0_010_0807,That's right.[l][p]
b0_010_0808,So it's all real... Honestly, I still find it[r]hard to believe.[l][p]
b0_010_0809,But I guess I have to now.[l][p]
b0_010_0810,I saw that curse stone appear in your hand[r]myself.[l][p]
b0_010_0811,It looked like it popped clean out of thin air.[l][p]
b0_010_0812,With evidence that clear, there's no denying[r]that there's some supernatural force at work.[l][p]
b0_010_0813,I...don't think you quite understand.[l][p]
b0_010_0814,...Oh?[l][p]
b0_010_0815,This isn't about evidence...and it isn't[r]about belief.[l][p]
b0_010_0816,It's...more than that.[l][p]
b0_010_0817,I know it's real.[l][p]
b0_010_0818,The moment the curse appeared, I knew[r]everything before it even said a word.[l][p]
b0_010_0819,It was already there in my head, as clear as day.[l][p]
b0_010_0820,You just knew, huh?[l][p]
b0_010_0821,It was etched onto my soul...along with the[r]curse echo's [c3]resentful memories[c0].[l][p]
b0_010_0822,So I can feel it. What it was like.[l][p]
b0_010_0823,Dying like they did, hundreds of years ago...[l][p]
b0_010_0824,wreathed in flame, writhing in pain as my[r]flesh blackens and my blood boils...[l][p]
b0_010_0825,I can feel it.[l][p]
b0_010_0826,All the agony.[r]All the rage.[l][p]
b0_010_0827,It...fills me with bloodlust.[l][p]
b0_010_0828,...[l][p]
b0_010_0829,I think...I need to kill someone.[l][p]
b0_010_0830,Anyone will do. Just as long as they're[r]carrying fire.[l][p]
b0_010_0831,I see. That could be a problem.[l][p]
b0_010_0832,You think so?[l][p]
b0_010_0833,From what I know of you...[l][p]
b0_010_0834,I was sure you'd see it as an opportunity.[l][p]
b0_010_0835,The stronger the desire to resurrect someone, the[r]stronger the urge to kill...[r]That's how it seems to me, anyway.[l][p]
b0_010_0836,Good grief. Talk about a spanner in the works.[l][p]
b0_010_0837,I say we take stock for a moment. Remind ourselves[r]where we've come from and where we're going.[l][p]
b0_010_0838,That...might be a good idea.[l][p]
b0_010_0839,The Rite of Resurrection, huh?[l][p]
b0_010_0840,I read about that in an occult magazine the other[r]day. Apparently some old book showed up recently[r]with all the gory details.[l][p]
b0_010_0841,And they say that the Rite can be found[r]somewhere in Honjo.[l][p]
b0_010_0842,I remember the first time you told me about that.[l][p]
b0_010_0843,It felt like...[l][p]
b0_010_0844,Like my prayers had been heard.[l][p]
b0_010_0845,Like I had hope, real hope, for the first time.[l][p]
b0_010_0846,...[l][p]
b0_010_0847,Ever since that awful day, I've wondered...[l][p]
b0_010_0848,What if I hadn't sent him to school?[l][p]
b0_010_0849,What if I'd just paid the ransom?[l][p]
b0_010_0850,Not a day goes by when I don't think that if I'd[r]done something differently, Shuichi would still[r]be alive.[l][p]
b0_010_0851,You can't blame yourself, ma'am. It was the[r]culprit's fault, not yours.[l][p]
b0_010_0852,Though I know that won't help any.[r]Grief is funny like that.[l][p]
b0_010_0853,I'm guessing that's why you're after the Rite?[l][p]
b0_010_0854,...[l][p]
b0_010_0855,Guess I didn't need to ask. It's written all[r]over your face.[l][p]
b0_010_0856,I can tell how much he meant to you.[l][p]
b0_010_0857,...[l][p]
b0_010_0858,But...and this is a big "but."[l][p]
b0_010_0859,If this Rite is the real deal, using it will mean[r]killing someone and stealing their soul.[l][p]
b0_010_0860,Is that a problem?[l][p]
b0_010_0861,If it comes to that, I'm afraid I'll have to[r]stop you.[l][p]
b0_010_0862,Oh... That's a shame.[l][p]
b0_010_0863,"A shame," huh? That's all?[l][p]
b0_010_0864,I'd thought...if I'm going to be competing with[r]other curse bearers...[l][p]
b0_010_0865,then your detective skills might come in[r]useful.[l][p]
b0_010_0866,You realize you're talking about ending someone's[r]life, right? Don't you see an issue with that?[l][p]
b0_010_0867,...[l][p]
b0_010_0868,I think any parent in my position...[r]would happily kill for a chance like this.[l][p]
b0_010_0869,That so, is it? Dear, oh dear.[r]What have I gotten myself into?[l][p]
b0_010_0870,If it makes you uncomfortable...[l][p]
b0_010_0871,then you won't have to get any blood on your[r]hands yourself.[l][p]
b0_010_0872,I don't need you to kill the other[r]curse bearers. I only need you to find them.[l][p]
b0_010_0873,I won't be party to murder, ma'am. Not even for[r]a client.[l][p]
b0_010_0874,...[l][p]
b0_010_0875,How much can I give you to change your mind?[l][p]
b0_010_0876,Sorry, ma'am, but not everyone has a price.[l][p]
b0_010_0877,I've got my policies, and I stick to them.[l][p]
b0_010_0878,I see. I didn't realize you were so stubborn.[l][p]
b0_010_0879,Let me say, though... It's not like I don't get[r]what you're going through.[l][p]
b0_010_0880,As long as you're not killing anyone with your[r]own hands...maybe I can help you out.[l][p]
b0_010_0881,What do you have in mind?[l][p]
b0_010_0882,Well...[l][p]
b0_010_0883,How about stealing someone else's curse stone[r]after they've filled it with soul dregs?[l][p]
b0_010_0884,...![l][p]
b0_010_0885,If that was all you were after, then I[r]could lend you my services guilt-free.[l][p]
b0_010_0886,If the other curse bearers want to kill each[r]other, that's their business. I'm not trying to[r]be a hero here.[l][p]
b0_010_0887,I guess there's no guarantee a stolen curse stone[r]will work, but we can worry about that later.[l][p]
b0_010_0888,Well, then. I suppose we have a deal.[l][p]
b0_010_0889,Although...what if I stole a curse stone using[r]my curse? Would you disapprove?[l][p]
b0_010_0890,...[l][p]
b0_010_0891,That would void our contract, ma'am. Just[r]warning you now.[l][p]
b0_010_0892,My.[l][p]
b0_010_0893,Before we go any further, why don't you tell[r]me about that curse of yours?[l][p]
b0_010_0894,The Haunting Clappers, was it? That's one of the[r]Seven Mysteries of Honjo, if I remember correctly.[l][p]
b0_010_0895,That's right.[l][p]
b0_010_0896,The original story did happen somewhere near here,[r]I think. I'm sure I remember hearing that...[l][p]
b0_010_0897,In that case, my money would be on all the[r]curse bearers being somewhere in Honjo.[l][p]
b0_010_0898,Our first move should be to narrow them down.[l][p]
b0_010_0899,Some of them are bound to try and come for[r]you first. We'll need to be ready.[l][p]
b0_010_0900,The curses make their bearers more willing to[r]kill, so an attack could come from anywhere.[l][p]
b0_010_0901,That sounds sensible.[l][p]
b0_010_0902,And if I remember correctly...[l][p]
b0_010_0903,Your Haunting Clappers can set people on fire,[r]but only if they have a naked flame or a lighter[r]on their person. Is that right?[l][p]
b0_010_0904,That's right.[l][p]
b0_010_0905,In olden times, wooden clappers were used to[r]warn people of fire. I'm guessing it punishes[r]those who don't heed the warning.[l][p]
b0_010_0906,It seems like a good curse to have. It's[r]simple and straightforward enough to use.[l][p]
b0_010_0907,Although it's hard to say how it stacks up without[r]knowing what else is on the table.[l][p]
b0_010_0908,You really think it's that good?[l][p]
b0_010_0909,The target can't do much to throw it off,[r]and it has a nice long activation window.[l][p]
b0_010_0910,It's big that it works on lighters too.[r]Just slip one into your target's pocket.[l][p]
b0_010_0911,And say that condition were already fulfilled[r]before they even knew you're there,[r]they wouldn't even know what hit them.[l][p]
b0_010_0912,Maybe...I won't have to actually use it.[l][p]
b0_010_0913,I could just tell someone I could...[r]and they'd have to do what I said.[l][p]
b0_010_0914,Threats could work. Although without any[r]proof, it'll come down to how convincing[r]you can be.[l][p]
b0_010_0915,If only you could use the curse, then back out[r]at the last second...[l][p]
b0_010_0916,At the last second?[l][p]
b0_010_0917,What an interesting idea.[l][p]
b0_010_0918,I have a lighter right here. We could try it now.[l][p]
b0_010_0919,That's...an interesting proposition.[l][p]
b0_010_0920,But maybe not. I'm not quite crazy enough[r]to make myself a guinea pig.[l][p]
b0_010_0921,Oh... I see.[l][p]
b0_010_0922,You're an odd one, ma'am, if you don't mind me[r]saying. And I don't think it's just the curse.[l][p]
b0_010_0923,You flatterer.[l][p]
b0_010_0924,As for what we do next... First of all, I think[r]you should stay indoors.[l][p]
b0_010_0925,Try not to do anything spontaneous or[r]outside of your normal routine.[l][p]
b0_010_0926,That's what you hired me for, ma'am. To look[r]into your son's kidnapping last year.[l][p]
b0_010_0927,To uncover the truth behind the [c4]abduction and[r]murder[c0] of Shuichi Shigima.[l][p]
b0_010_0928,Oh, yes. I remember.[l][p]
b0_010_0929,They never did find the one who did it...[l][p]
b0_010_0930,That's what I'm here about today, in fact. Kind[r]of you to let me drop by so late, by the way.[l][p]
b0_010_0931,I've been turning over every last stone, and[r]I've come up with a grand total of...[l][p]
b0_010_0932,one lead![l][p]
b0_010_0933,So you said.[l][p]
b0_010_0934,As far as the police are concerned, it's[r]a cold case, but I've managed to make[r]some headway.[l][p]
b0_010_0935,I remember. You were just about to tell me.[l][p]
b0_010_0936,You know, we still need to figure out exactly[r]what you want me to do.[l][p]
b0_010_0937,Tell you what, why don't I tell you what I've[r]found, and then we can make a decision.[l][p]
b0_010_0938,All right.[l][p]
b0_010_0939,Right, then. Have you decided what you want me[r]working on?[l][p]
b0_010_0940,...[l][p]
b0_010_0941,...Bringing my son back is more important.[l][p]
b0_010_0942,I want you to help me with the Rite of[r]Resurrection.[l][p]
b0_010_0943,Roger that. The Rite it is.[l][p]
b0_010_0944,Finally... Finally, I have a lead.[r]I need to know what happened to my son.[l][p]
b0_010_0945,Your wish is my command, ma'am.[l][p]
b0_010_0946,I'll focus all my efforts on looking into[r]the kidnapping.[l][p]
b0_010_0947,Although...something just occurred to me.[l][p]
b0_010_0948,You can't investigate the matter at night,[r]can you?[l][p]
b0_010_0949,At least until the sun rises...could you search[r]for the other curse bearers?[l][p]
b0_010_0950,Heh. All right. I see how it is.[l][p]
b0_010_0951,Well, I'd be happy to help.[l][p]
b0_010_0952,Odds are good that the others curse bearers[r]are also working by night.[l][p]
b0_010_0953,Anyone they kill under the cover of darkness[r]won't be discovered until sunrise.[l][p]
b0_010_0954,I bet they'll be trying to do as much as they[r]can before morning comes.[l][p]
b0_010_0955,So, it's settled, then. I'll look into the[r]other curse bearers by night.[l][p]
b0_010_0956,And once the city wakes up and I can start[r]asking questions...[l][p]
b0_010_0957,I'll investigate the kidnapping as well.[l][p]
b0_010_0958,I'll even try and find Ms. Shiraishi as[r]part of the bargain.[l][p]
b0_010_0959,Thank you. That's...more than enough.[l][p]
b0_010_0960,I suppose there's not much point going over[r]the kidnapping itself.[l][p]
b0_010_0961,No. I'm...very familiar.[l][p]
b0_010_0962,Then I'll leave that for the files to cover and[r]just confirm a few things about the case.[l][p]
b0_010_0963,The police traced the culprit's calls back to...[r]Let's see here...[l][p]
b0_010_0964,Northern Oyoko River, here in Sumida City.[r]That's quite a wide area.[l][p]
b0_010_0965,That's right.[l][p]
b0_010_0966,In the end, they never managed to nail down[r]exactly where the calls were coming from...[l][p]
b0_010_0967,but it was almost certainly the same location[r]that Shuichi was being held captive.[l][p]
b0_010_0968,Since Shuichi's voice could be heard during[r]the killer's calls.[l][p]
b0_010_0969,...[l][p]
b0_010_0970,Northern Oyoko River is quite a distance from[r]Shuichi's normal school commute.[l][p]
b0_010_0971,Factoring in that he was seen at school but[r]went missing before he arrived at his house...[l][p]
b0_010_0972,it's likely that he was abducted by car on[r]his route home.[l][p]
b0_010_0973,Maybe, but...[l][p]
b0_010_0974,Exactly. Shuichi was a clever boy.[l][p]
b0_010_0975,He never would have gotten into a car with[r]a stranger.[l][p]
b0_010_0976,That's right.[l][p]
b0_010_0977,I was very firm about that. I know he understood,[r]too. I even saw him warning the other children.[l][p]
b0_010_0978,It's possible that they forced him into the car.[l][p]
b0_010_0979,The only issue there is...there weren't any[r]witnesses to the kidnapping.[l][p]
b0_010_0980,You can't bundle someone into a car with[r]that many students around and not be noticed.[l][p]
b0_010_0981,But nobody came forward to say they saw[r]anything suspicious.[l][p]
b0_010_0982,So, did they target him at some other time,[r]or somewhere away from his usual route?[l][p]
b0_010_0983,Both of those seem a little far-fetched.[l][p]
b0_010_0984,Which raises the question...how did the[r]kidnapper pull it off?[l][p]
b0_010_0985,...[l][p]
b0_010_0986,The police never managed to find an answer.[l][p]
b0_010_0987,In the end, they decided that the kidnapper[r]must just have gotten lucky.[l][p]
b0_010_0988,Well, why not turn the problem on its head?[l][p]
b0_010_0989,The kidnapper managed to convince[r]Shuichi to get into their car...but how?[l][p]
b0_010_0990,The only thing that makes sense to me...[l][p]
b0_010_0991,...[l][p]
b0_010_0992,...is if they were somebody that he would have a[r]reason to trust.[l][p]
b0_010_0993,A teacher, perhaps, or a relative. Or somebody[r]else that he knew.[l][p]
b0_010_0994,But all of the adults Shuichi knew had alibis.[l][p]
b0_010_0995,The police checked them all thoroughly.[l][p]
b0_010_0996,They did, huh? No one throws numbers at a[r]problem like the cops.[l][p]
b0_010_0997,But what if it wasn't someone he knew...[r]Or rather...[l][p]
b0_010_0998,What if the culprit disguised themselves as a[r]police officer?[l][p]
b0_010_0999,...!?[l][p]
b0_010_1000,That would explain why he didn't find them[r]suspicious.[l][p]
b0_010_1001,The Shigima family has close ties with the[r]police, after all. He would have had a reason[r]to trust them.[l][p]
b0_010_1002,...You might be right.[l][p]
b0_010_1003,But...surely...that couldn't have...[l][p]
b0_010_1004,Well, there's a problem with the theory. You'd be[r]surprised how much police officers stand out.[l][p]
b0_010_1005,That's sort of the point, after all. They're[r]meant to be a visible deterrent against crime.[l][p]
b0_010_1006,...[l][p]
b0_010_1007,But here's another interesting little bit of[r]trivia I happen to know.[l][p]
b0_010_1008,When you ask people to imagine someone[r]suspicious, nobody pictures women or children.[l][p]
b0_010_1009,...?[l][p]
b0_010_1010,Even kids who've been warned about stranger[r]danger...[l][p]
b0_010_1011,often subconsciously expect that danger to[r]look like an adult man.[l][p]
b0_010_1012,Besides, Shuichi was the sort of boy who wanted to[r]be a police officer when he grew up.[l][p]
b0_010_1013,He must have had a very strong sense of[r]right and wrong.[l][p]
b0_010_1014,That's right.[l][p]
b0_010_1015,Wait... Surely you can't mean...?[l][p]
b0_010_1016,Now you're getting it.[l][p]
b0_010_1017,If, say, a young woman approached Shuichi asking[r]for help...what would he have done?[l][p]
b0_010_1018,...![l][p]
b0_010_1019,If someone like that said they were lost and[r]asked him for directions...[l][p]
b0_010_1020,would he have gotten into a car?[l][p]
b0_010_1021,...He might have.
b0_010_1022,My husband always told him that a man had a[r]duty to watch out for women and children.[l][p]
b0_010_1023,You could certainly argue that kind of[r]attitude is outdated nowadays...[l][p]
b0_010_1024,but if Shuichi believed it, then we might[r]have something here.[l][p]
b0_010_1025,Then you think the culprit was a young woman?[l][p]
b0_010_1026,But...it was a man's voice on the phone...[l][p]
b0_010_1027,She might have been an accomplice...or maybe[r]she didn't even realize she was being used.[l][p]
b0_010_1028,If anything, that would explain why she[r]hasn't come forward.[l][p]
b0_010_1029,She herself might not realize she had[r]anything to do with the case.[l][p]
b0_010_1030,So, the question is...did anybody see Shuichi[r]speaking with a young woman on the day of his[r]disappearance?[l][p]
b0_010_1031,See, what I said about people's biases...[r]That goes for witnesses too.[l][p]
b0_010_1032,And I figured that maybe, if I started asking[r]new questions, I might get some new answers.[l][p]
b0_010_1033,So I spent my day asking around Shuichi's school[r]route, seeing if anyone had seen something.[l][p]
b0_010_1034,...[l][p]
b0_010_1035,And one man thought he had.
b0_010_1036,Do you mean...he saw it happen?[l][p]
b0_010_1037,Well, I can't say that for sure yet.[l][p]
b0_010_1038,It turned out he wanted something from me,[r]so he asked if we could talk in private.[l][p]
b0_010_1039,<cspace=-1px><color=#ddd><font="TELOP">[x0.6]Several hours earlier...
b0_010_1040,All right. This should do.[l][p]
b0_010_1041,There's no one around. We can speak in[r]confidence.[l][p]
b0_010_1042,Erm... Excuse me, what was your name again?[l][p]
b0_010_1043,Jonouchi.[l][p]
b0_010_1044,Got it. Well, Jonouchi, I'm all ears.[l][p]
b0_010_1045,...[l][p]
b0_010_1046,Just so we're on the same page...[l][p]
b0_010_1047,You're a private detective investigating Shuichi[r]Shigima's kidnapping. Do I have that right?[l][p]
b0_010_1048,Of course. What else do I look like?[l][p]
b0_010_1049,How should I know what a private detective[r]looks like... Oh, forget it.[l][p]
b0_010_1050,Look, I'll tell you straight.[l][p]
b0_010_1051,My life is in danger. I need your help.[l][p]
b0_010_1052,...!?[l][p]
b0_010_1053,You'll excuse me if that caught me a little[r]off guard.[l][p]
b0_010_1054,Let me ask you straight.[l][p]
b0_010_1055,Who is trying to kill you?[l][p]
b0_010_1056,...[l][p]
b0_010_1057,...A student called [c3]Michiyo Shiraishi[c0].[l][p]
b0_010_1058,Interesting.[l][p]
b0_010_1059,A schoolgirl, eh?[l][p]
b0_010_1060,Sounds like you've been naughty.[l][p]
b0_010_1061,I-it's nothing like that! That girl... She's[r]a murderer![l][p]
b0_010_1062,I'm the only one who knows, but I saw what[r]she did![l][p]
b0_010_1063,Michiyo Shiraishi... I saw her kidnap Shuichi Shigima!
b0_010_1064,Come again?[l][p]
b0_010_1065,I saw her talk to him on the street and lead[r]him away. I didn't think much of it at the time...[r]but then he went missing.[l][p]
b0_010_1066,She murdered him, I'm sure of it! Or at least,[r]she's got something to do with it![l][p]
b0_010_1067,That's what you're here for, isn't it? Then you[r]can't let her get to me![l][p]
b0_010_1068,If that's true, you've been sitting on some[r]valuable information.[l][p]
b0_010_1069,Why didn't you tell anybody?[l][p]
b0_010_1070,Well...you see...[l][p]
b0_010_1071,If you can't explain that, I don't have any[r]reason to believe you.[l][p]
b0_010_1072,I-I couldn't![l][p]
b0_010_1073,S-she told me she'd kill me if I spoke a word![l][p]
b0_010_1074,You're telling me a schoolgirl had you[r]scared for your life?[l][p]
b0_010_1075,So you've been sitting on that all this time...[r]and you think she's coming for you now that[r]you've spilled the beans?[l][p]
b0_010_1076,Yes! That's it! Exactly![l][p]
b0_010_1077,I'm begging you, don't let her get me![l][p]
b0_010_1078,Arrest her, I'm telling you! She's a demon![l][p]
b0_010_1079,Well, you seem to believe what you're saying...[l][p]
b0_010_1080,But it just doesn't add up.[l][p]
b0_010_1081,How could a schoolgirl have a fully grown[r]man so terrified?[l][p]
b0_010_1082,You don't know what she can do! She'll...[r]She'll curse me![l][p]
b0_010_1083,Curse you?[l][p]
b0_010_1084,I'm sorry, but you're losing me here.[l][p]
b0_010_1085,I-It's true! Her house, it's...[l][p]
b0_010_1086,Agh, forget it! Why do I even bother!?[l][p]
b0_010_1087,You seemed dubious enough to believe me...but[r]I should have known you'd never understand![l][p]
b0_010_1088,Enough! I'll find someone else to help me![l][p]
b0_010_1089,Hey...![l][p]
b0_010_1090,Hmm...[l][p]
b0_010_1091,And that's about the long and short of it.[l][p]
b0_010_1092,I... I can hardly believe it...[l][p]
b0_010_1093,At the time, I thought his mention of curses[r]was just crazy talk...[l][p]
b0_010_1094,but I'm starting to see that there might have[r]been more to it.[l][p]
b0_010_1095,Then...if we can just find that girl...![l][p]
b0_010_1096,Curse or no curse, if she was with Shuichi[r]on the day of the kidnapping...[l][p]
b0_010_1097,then there's a good chance she knows something.[l][p]
b0_010_1098,On top of that, I did some digging on the man[r]I spoke to.[l][p]
b0_010_1099,His full name's [c4]Kohei Jonouchi[c0]. He's a teacher at[r]Komagata High School here in Sumida.[l][p]
b0_010_1100,A teacher? Then this schoolgirl...[l][p]
b0_010_1101,Is one of his students? I think that's[r]very likely.[l][p]
b0_010_1102,...![l][p]
b0_010_1103,At last, we've got a lead. Hopefully, it'll[r]be the breakthrough we're looking for.[l][p]
b0_010_1104,Now, then.[l][p]
b0_010_1105,I should get to work. There's only so much time[r]before sunrise.[l][p]
b0_010_1106,I'll call you if I find out anything new. You[r]stay here and keep a lookout.[l][p]
b0_010_1107,All right.[l][p]
b0_010_1108,There's no telling what kinds of curses you[r]might find out on the streets tonight.[l][p]
b0_010_1109,Don't go outside if you can help it...and try[r]to be ready for anything.[l][p]
b0_010_1110,I will.[l][p]
b0_010_1111,Well, if that's all, I should be going.[l][p]

b0_020_0550,It's been almost an hour since Richter left.[l][p]
b0_020_0551,He promised he'd call me if anything happened...[l][p]
b0_020_0552,but he hasn't.[l][p]
b0_020_0553,So all I can do is wait. And wait.[l][p]
b0_020_0554,The ticking seems so loud.[r]It just goes to show how quiet it is...[l][p]
b0_020_0555,I'm waiting for Richter to contact me...[r]but he hasn't.[l][p]
b0_020_0556,I've made sure the receiver is on the hook.[r]It'll ring as soon as he calls.[l][p]
b0_020_0557,Ah...![l][p]
b0_020_0558,That must be him.[l][p]
b0_020_0559,Hello, Shigima residence.[l][p]
b0_020_0560,It's a fax machine.[r]I rarely find a use for it.[l][p]
b0_020_0561,I don't know anybody else who owns one.[l][p]
b0_020_0562,That old hanging scroll.[l][p]
b0_020_0563,I've seen it too often to feel anything from[r]it now.[l][p]
b0_020_0564,Should I put a record on?[l][p]
b0_020_0565,No, it's too late for that.[r]I'm not in the mood for music, anyway.[l][p]
b0_020_0566,There's nothing on at this hour.[l][p]
b0_020_0567,I see no point in turning it on.[l][p]
b0_020_0568,My husband used to complain that it was too[r]dark, but I rather like the gloom.[l][p]
b0_020_0569,Come to think of it, I never offered him[r]any tea.[l][p]
b0_020_0570,Not that I ever learned how to make it.[l][p]
b0_020_0571,The flowers put me at ease, just a little.[l][p]
b0_020_0572,What's this? A newspaper?[l][p]
b0_020_0573,It must have fallen off the chair...[l][p]
b0_020_0574,It's a newspaper.[l][p]
b0_020_0575,I only leave them in here for the guests.[r]I hardly ever read them myself.[l][p]
b0_020_0576,I don't think I've taken the time to go over one[r]in years, in fact...[l][p]
b0_020_0577,Well, it's not like I have anything better[r]to do.[l][p]
b0_020_0578,It looks like the city's biggest problem[r]right now is pollution.[l][p]
b0_020_0579,I remember how the air and water[r]used to be even more polluted.[l][p]
b0_020_0580,The river was covered in scum from all the[r]sewage and industrial waste, and it stank[r]so badly it'd make my eyes water.[l][p]
b0_020_0581,Eventually, people started getting sick, and it[r]couldn't be ignored anymore. Fortunately, it's[r]gotten better since then.[l][p]
b0_020_0582,Although the air around the industrial district[r]is still filthy with gas and smog.[l][p]
b0_020_0583,...If there's one thing Honjo never wants for,[r]it's horrific crimes.[l][p]
b0_020_0584,They found a police officer dead in a local[r]park just the other day.[l][p]
b0_020_0585,A lot of my family are in the police.[r]I hope it wasn't anybody I knew...[l][p]
b0_020_0586,I don't read the news anymore. Not since[r]last year. It brings back bad memories.[l][p]
b0_020_0587,"Suicide at Local High School...?"[l][p]
b0_020_0588,Oh...I remember that. A high school girl[r]jumped off a roof about a week ago.[l][p]
b0_020_0589,She was bullied, I think...or maybe it was[r]something about exam pressure...?[l][p]
b0_020_0590,...!?[l][p]
b0_020_0591,What...? But...[l][p]
b0_020_0592,No, this can't be right...[l][p]
b0_020_0593,Her name...[l][p]
b0_020_0594,[c3]Michiyo Shiraishi[c0] from Komagata High School?
b0_020_0595,It can't be...[l][p]
b0_020_0596,Michiyo Shiraishi...is dead?[l][p]
b0_020_0597,All sorts of articles about the current state[r]of the economy.[l][p]
b0_020_0598,Now that the postwar boom has passed its peak,[r]we're moving into the era of large corporations.[l][p]
b0_020_0599,It's about 220-230 yen to the dollar.[r]Manufacturing is on the rise and exports are[r]healthy.[l][p]
b0_020_0600,The dollar's down from its height, and people[r]are saying it could fall further.[l][p]
b0_020_0601,There's no denying how much the standard of[r]living has improved in the past few years.[l][p]
b0_020_0602,It's common to own a car and television now, and[r]supermarkets are better stocked than ever.[l][p]
b0_020_0603,Although with everyone flocking to the city,[r]land prices are skyrocketing. Nowadays, most[r]people can only dream of homeownership.[l][p]
b0_020_0604,The city center's going to be nothing but[r]apartments before long...[l][p]
b0_020_0605,Hmm...[l][p]
b0_020_0606,I'm not exactly a businesswoman, so this all[r]feels like another world to me.[l][p]
b0_020_0607,Now that everyone has more spending money to[r]go around, people are coming up with all kinds[r]of new diversions.[l][p]
b0_020_0608,It seems like only yesterday that people were[r]flocking to the arcades to shoot aliens...[l][p]
b0_020_0609,but now we have these enormous theme parks,[r]and gaming machines that plug straight into[r]our televisions.[l][p]
b0_020_0610,Everyone's talking about superhero series,[r]foreign films, and movies based on the latest[r]bestseller.[l][p]
b0_020_0611,Back in my day, fusion rock and folk music[r]was all the rage...[l][p]
b0_020_0612,but now it's all about city pop and idols.[l][p]
b0_020_0613,I find it hard to care about that sort of[r]thing anymore.[l][p]
b0_020_0614,I hear the new big thing is some mascot[r]line of delinquent birds. Mocking Birds,[r]I think it's called.[l][p]
b0_020_0615,Was that what Richter was talking about?[l][p]
b0_020_0616,Trends seem to have such short shelf-lives now,[r]with how quickly the times are changing.[l][p]
b0_020_0617,I think I'm just too old to keep up anymore.[l][p]
b0_020_0618,It's young people who are leading the way,[r]with their modern worldviews. My generation[r]will only fall further behind.[l][p]
b0_020_0619,Everyone attends high school now, even girls.[r]Universal education policy, they call it.[l][p]
b0_020_0620,The country's gotten rich enough that every[r]child can go to school.[l][p]
b0_020_0621,Education is the backbone of modern society.[r]If you want to work for a good company,[r]you have to get into a good university.[l][p]
b0_020_0622,With more people in the running than ever,[r]the competition to get into those universities[r]has gotten fierce though.[l][p]
b0_020_0623,The new generation is rebelling. Schoolyard[r]violence and delinquency are on the rise.[l][p]
b0_020_0624,But my boy was too sensible to get[r]mixed up in any of that...[l][p]
b0_020_0625,...[l][p]
b0_020_0626,...I don't want to read anymore. It'll only[r]remind me of him.[l][p]
b0_020_0627,I don't really watch much television.[l][p]
b0_020_0628,It feels as if all the information in[r]the world gets passed through that little[r]black box.[l][p]
b0_020_0629,But Father stopped them from reporting on the[r]kidnapping, back when it happened.[r]I was glad about that. Less fuss.[l][p]
b0_020_0630,Now the comedy boom is over, all the[r]comedians are flocking to other genres.[l][p]
b0_020_0631,The occult seems really popular at the moment.[r]Look at all these paranormal specials...[l][p]
b0_020_0632,<i>I know it's dangerous to go out...[l][p]
b0_020_0633,<i>but I can't just sit here and let this[r]opportunity pass me by.[l][p]
b0_020_0634,<i>I have to look for her. For Michiyo Shiraishi.[l][p]
b0_020_0635,<i>But first...I need to find more soul dregs.[l][p]
b0_020_0636,<i>I need to distract myself somehow. I don't[r]want to be alone with my thoughts.[l][p]
b0_020_0637,<i>Maybe reading the newspaper will take my mind[r]off things.[l][p]
b0_020_0638,<i>Michiyo Shiraishi, the same girl who witnessed my[r]son's kidnapping...committed suicide last week?[l][p]
b0_020_0639,<i>But that means...[l][p]
b0_020_0640,<i>Mr. Jonouchi was terrified of someone who[r]already died?[l][p]
b0_020_0641,<i>Is that what he meant by a curse?[l][p]
b0_020_0642,<i>I can't work this out on my own...[r]Maybe Richter will know...[l][p]
b0_020_0643,<i>Why won't he call? Oh, I haven't left it[r]off the hook, have I?[l][p]
b0_020_0644,<i>It's ringing...[r]I better pick up quickly.[l][p]

b0_020_0647,Richter called me out to meet him, and we[r]came here, to Komagata Bridge.[l][p]
b0_020_0648,Richter...[r]There's something I need to tell you.[l][p]
b0_020_0649,Funny, I was just thinking the same thing.[l][p]
b0_020_0650,We're on Komagata Bridge, over the Sumida River.[l][p]
b0_020_0651,There's a highway on one side and a freeway on[r]the other, but they're both deserted this late[r]at night.[l][p]
b0_020_0652,The Sumida River.[l][p]
b0_020_0653,The water is filthy and horrid, but at night,[r]when it's still, it looks almost peaceful.[l][p]
b0_020_0654,Can I ask you something, ma'am?[l][p]
b0_020_0655,Is the Sumida River what you Honjo folks picture[r]when you think of home?[l][p]
b0_020_0656,I couldn't say.[l][p]
b0_020_0657,All I can tell you...[l][p]
b0_020_0658,is that I can hardly stand the sight of it.[l][p]
b0_020_0659,...[l][p]
b0_020_0660,Right. Should've guessed.[l][p]
b0_020_0661,This was where they found him, after he[r]went missing.[l][p]
b0_020_0662,All alone, floating in that horrible water.[l][p]
b0_020_0663,All I can think...is how scared he must have been.[r]How cold he must have been.[l][p]
b0_020_0664,What did he ever do to deserve something so[r]awful?[l][p]
b0_020_0665,...[l][p]
b0_020_0666,I've come here every day since then...[l][p]
b0_020_0667,And I prayed to the river to give him back.[l][p]
b0_020_0668,To give me back my son.[l][p]
b0_020_0669,Day after day after day...[l][p]
b0_020_0670,...[l][p]
b0_020_0671,You know, in olden times, people believed[r]rivers marked where our world met the next.[l][p]
b0_020_0672,...?[l][p]
b0_020_0673,So the act of crossing flowing water[r]had a huge amount of spiritual significance.[l][p]
b0_020_0674,Back when Edo was founded, the people of Chuo[r]saw the Sumida River the same way.[l][p]
b0_020_0675,They associated the far side of the river with[r]the afterlife. That same place would later become[r]Honjo.[l][p]
b0_020_0676,All their fear and revulsion accumulated there[r]and took root.[l][p]
b0_020_0677,But then the Ryogoku Bridge sprang up after the[r]Great Fire of Meireki, and just like that, Honjo[r]was part of the city too.[l][p]
b0_020_0678,And as it turned from farmland into a town,[r]the people surrounded it with manmade rivers[r]and crisscrossed it with canals and waterways.[l][p]
b0_020_0679,Weren't those to prevent flooding? That's[r]what I was told...[l][p]
b0_020_0680,They were, but that's not all they were for.[l][p]
b0_020_0681,Their other purpose was to contain all the[r]corruption that had built up on the far shore...[l][p]
b0_020_0682,and stop it leaking through to our side of the[r]great divide.[l][p]
b0_020_0683,Officially, they were a physical barrier, but[r]unofficially, they were a spiritual one too.[l][p]
b0_020_0684,So, if I have this right...[l][p]
b0_020_0685,Are you saying...that Honjo is a place where[r]the real world meets the afterlife?[l][p]
b0_020_0686,Exactly. That's why the Rite of Resurrection is[r]here, rather than anywhere else. I'm sure of it.[l][p]
b0_020_0687,And it's probably why the Seven Mysteries and[r]their curses have survived to the modern day.[l][p]
b0_020_0688,And I guess that would make this spot we're[r]standing now, right over the water...[l][p]
b0_020_0689,the border between life and death.[l][p]
b0_020_0690,If there ever was a place where bringing back[r]the dead might be possible...I reckon it's here.[l][p]
b0_020_0691,It's funny that you mention praying to the river.[r]That might have done more than you think.[l][p]
b0_020_0692,Is that supposed to make me feel better?[l][p]
b0_020_0693,Just thinking aloud, ma'am.[l][p]
b0_020_0694,Hm...[l][p]
b0_020_0695,Well, it's a nice thought.[l][p]
b0_020_0696,Oh, that's right.[l][p]
b0_020_0697,There's one more memory I have of this river.[l][p]
b0_020_0698,Do you mind if I tell you?[l][p]
b0_020_0699,Go ahead.[l][p]
b0_020_0700,It must've been about twenty years now, when I[r]was still a schoolgirl.[l][p]
b0_020_0701,Back then, the Sumida River was much filthier[r]than it is now.[l][p]
b0_020_0702,It was full of garbage and industrial discharge.[r]It was scummy, and slimy, and it stank.[l][p]
b0_020_0703,You could look out over the water and see[r]dead cats and dogs and pigeons just...floating.[l][p]
b0_020_0704,And one day, among all the filth and garbage...[l][p]
b0_020_0705,There was a piece of my missing [c3]classmate's hand[c0].
b0_020_0706,...What?[l][p]
b0_020_0707,It was almost a miracle, when you stop to[r]think about it.[l][p]
b0_020_0708,What were the chances that someone would find[r]a part of her that was still recognizable?[l][p]
b0_020_0709,And that although everything but the palm had[r]rotted away in the water...[l][p]
b0_020_0710,The part that was left would have an[r]identifiable scar?[l][p]
b0_020_0711,And that they could tell it'd been a murder[r]from the blade marks on the bone?[l][p]
b0_020_0712,...![l][p]
b0_020_0713,Wait...[l][p]
b0_020_0714,Are you talking about [c4]the Nejima Murders[c0]?[l][p]
b0_020_0715,So you have heard of it. I'm impressed.[l][p]
b0_020_0716,I assume you were but an elementary[r]schooler at the time?[l][p]
b0_020_0717,I wasn't really aware of it then. I only heard[r]about it after the fact.[l][p]
b0_020_0718,I had no idea the victim was a classmate of[r]yours...[l][p]
b0_020_0719,To be honest, it was all a bit of a blur.[l][p]
b0_020_0720,A wave of chaos, just parting around me.[l][p]
b0_020_0721,Something like that.[l][p]
b0_020_0722,They said the rest of her body must have sunk[r]to the bottom of the river.[l][p]
b0_020_0723,They combed the riverbed, but they only[r]ever found pieces.[l][p]
b0_020_0724,Everything else must have rotted and flowed[r]out to sea.[l][p]
b0_020_0725,Afterwards, I heard that all the divers who[r]had been looking for her fell ill.[l][p]
b0_020_0726,A sorry story for everyone involved, huh?[l][p]
b0_020_0727,It's funny. Everyone figures the river's filthy[r]already, so one more piece of garbage won't hurt.[l][p]
b0_020_0728,But every little bit makes it worse. It's a[r]vicious cycle.[l][p]
b0_020_0729,I know I wouldn't want to go rooting around[r]down there myself.[l][p]
b0_020_0730,That's right. Which is why the riverbed is the[r]last place anybody would go looking.[l][p]
b0_020_0731,Or so was the killer's thinking, I suppose.[l][p]
b0_020_0732,The times were changing quickly back then.[r]Things were confusing. Everyone seemed to be[r]in a hurry.[l][p]
b0_020_0733,Young people were moving to Tokyo in droves.[r]Some even ran away from home to make it in[r]the big city.[l][p]
b0_020_0734,And they made easy targets for bad people.[l][p]
b0_020_0735,A lot of them ended up disappearing without[r]a trace.[l][p]
b0_020_0736,...?[l][p]
b0_020_0737,You see, back then...[l][p]
b0_020_0738,if you chopped a body up into tiny pieces and[r]threw it in the river...[l][p]
b0_020_0739,it would rot, quickly and discreetly, and sink[r]to the bottom, never to be seen again.[l][p]
b0_020_0740,Are you saying what I think you're saying?[l][p]
b0_020_0741,They arrested him shortly after.[r]Fumichika Nejima.[l][p]
b0_020_0742,The man who killed my classmate and cut her[r]into pieces.[l][p]
b0_020_0743,He was so methodical about it, it couldn't have[r]been his first crime.[l][p]
b0_020_0744,And people began to wonder how many other[r]girls he'd murdered the same way.[l][p]
b0_020_0745,The police never found any evidence of other[r]murders, in the end.[l][p]
b0_020_0746,But the river knows the truth.[l][p]
b0_020_0747,...[l][p]
b0_020_0748,How many corpses has it swallowed up over the[r]years, I wonder.[l][p]
b0_020_0749,That same thought spread through everyone's[r]mind, and they started to avoid this area.[l][p]
b0_020_0750,So really...[l][p]
b0_020_0751,this river has been rank with corruption for[r]decades now.[l][p]
b0_020_0752,Or at least, that's how it seems to me.[l][p]
b0_020_0753,Well? Was that interesting?[l][p]
b0_020_0754,Well, I can see why you don't have any good[r]memories of this river.[l][p]
b0_020_0755,With all that darkness lurking beneath the[r]surface, there's no reason that you would.[l][p]
b0_020_0756,Still, if I may, ma'am...I'm surprised you[r]know so much about the Nejima Murders.[l][p]
b0_020_0757,But how could I not?[l][p]
b0_020_0758,After all...[l][p]
b0_020_0759,I was the one...[l][p]
b0_020_0760,who found the hand.
b0_020_0761,...![l][p]
b0_020_0762,The police actually wrote me a thank-you letter.[l][p]
b0_020_0763,They said it was only thanks to me that they[r]managed to bring Nejima to justice.[l][p]
b0_020_0764,That was the only time my father ever said he[r]was proud of me.[l][p]
b0_020_0765,Huh.[l][p]
b0_020_0766,I guess it just wasn't the killer's day.[l][p]
b0_020_0767,Sometimes I wonder if he resents me for it.[l][p]
b0_020_0768,The Sumida River...[l][p]
b0_020_0769,I have nothing but awful memories of it.[l][p]
b0_020_0770,He's gazing down at the water.[l][p]
b0_020_0771,What does he see down there, I wonder?[l][p]
b0_020_0772,Didn't you want to tell me something?[l][p]
b0_020_0773,I've already said everything I wanted to say.[l][p]
b0_020_0774,Please, go ahead.[l][p]
b0_020_0775,All right, then.[l][p]
b0_020_0776,I've been poking around places connected to the[r]Seven Mysteries, looking for curse bearers...[l][p]
b0_020_0777,and I think I've found a few candidates.[l][p]
b0_020_0778,First, a tall man I ran into in Kinshibori Park.[l][p]
b0_020_0779,I asked him for directions, trying to probe him a[r]little, but he turned the questions right back[r]around on me.[l][p]
b0_020_0780,And he was out of there the second he figured[r]I wasn't what he was looking for.[l][p]
b0_020_0781,I got the sense curses were nothing new to him.[r]I'm about forty percent sure he's a curse bearer.[l][p]
b0_020_0782,Then there's this middle-aged guy I saw[r]on South Warigesui Street.[l][p]
b0_020_0783,There's no question about this one. He had one[r]of the curse stones in his hand.[l][p]
b0_020_0784,He had a nervous air about him, too. It was[r]clear he was up to some shady business.[l][p]
b0_020_0785,Gathering soul dregs, I'd bet. He'd make a good[r]target.[l][p]
b0_020_0786,Next up is a pair. A young man and woman I[r]saw around Ryogoku Bridge.[l][p]
b0_020_0787,This time, the man came up to me and asked me[r]flat out if I was a curse bearer.[l][p]
b0_020_0788,I told him I didn't know what he was talking[r]about, and he backpedaled and left.[l][p]
b0_020_0789,Looks like they lurk around there often.[r]Looking for kindred spirits, would be my guess.[l][p]
b0_020_0790,Though it didn't seem like they were quite[r]working as a pair.[l][p]
b0_020_0791,Gathering soul dregs in a group might be a decent[r]idea, if you could make it work...[l][p]
b0_020_0792,but with things being how they are, it's[r]got to be hard to find folks one can trust.[l][p]
b0_020_0793,They've got brass, though. I don't know what[r]their deal is, but I'd like to find out.[l][p]
b0_020_0794,Last is two detectives I've seen sniffing around.[l][p]
b0_020_0795,The police are involved...?[l][p]
b0_020_0796,Not necessarily. A body turned up in a local[r]park a few days ago, so they might just be[r]looking into that.[l][p]
b0_020_0797,Still, the park's got ties to one of the Seven[r]Mysteries. Might be it was a curse that[r]did the guy in.[l][p]
b0_020_0798,And if they're sending in detectives from the[r]head office, then something's got to be up.[l][p]
b0_020_0799,How do you know where they're from?[l][p]
b0_020_0800,Let's just say that when you're in this business,[r]there are some faces you get to know.[l][p]
b0_020_0801,Anyway, that's everyone who's caught my eye.[l][p]
b0_020_0802,You found all of them in so little time?[r]I really did hire the best.[l][p]
b0_020_0803,It's all in the name, ma'am.[r]Richter Kai, P.I.[l][p]
b0_020_0804,No, wait... Make that Richter Kai, investigator[r]extraordinaire.[l][p]
b0_020_0805,My. An investigator extraordinaire...[l][p]
b0_020_0806,Is that why you can dress like that without[r]drawing attention to yourself?[l][p]
b0_020_0807,You bet. An investigator extraordinaire can blend[r]in like a chameleon in any outfit.[l][p]
b0_020_0808,Well, that aside...[l][p]
b0_020_0809,The middle-aged man and the young couple sound[r]the most promising. Am I right?[l][p]
b0_020_0810,Whichever we pick, it's still too early to[r]make a move.[l][p]
b0_020_0811,It seems like the curse bearers are less[r]involved with each other than we thought.[l][p]
b0_020_0812,Plus, there're still others we don't know about.[r]I say we hang fire and see how things play out.[l][p]
b0_020_0813,Once more bodies start showing up, that'll[r]get the pot nice and hot.[l][p]
b0_020_0814,And once it's boiling, our chance will come.[l][p]
b0_020_0815,There's something I need to tell you.[l][p]
b0_020_0816,What's up?[l][p]
b0_020_0817,Well...[l][p]
b0_020_0818,That girl...Michiyo Shiraishi...[l][p]
b0_020_0819,The one who was with Shuichi on the day of[r]the kidnapping?[l][p]
b0_020_0820,That's her. Well...[l][p]
b0_020_0821,she's dead.[l][p]
b0_020_0822,She's what?[l][p]
b0_020_0823,The student who committed suicide last week...[r]That was her.[l][p]
b0_020_0824,I heard something like that had happened.[r]Never got the name, though.[l][p]
b0_020_0825,Talk about bad luck...[l][p]
b0_020_0826,We finally get a lead, only to find it's[r]turned into a literal dead end.[l][p]
b0_020_0827,Unless...her death was the whole reason[r]Jonouchi was so shaken up.[l][p]
b0_020_0828,He said she was going to curse him. Was he talking[r]about her taking revenge from beyond the grave?[l][p]
b0_020_0829,It seems like we're back where we started.[l][p]
b0_020_0830,Not necessarily. That teacher knows something,[r]I'm sure of it.[l][p]
b0_020_0831,At the very least, I'd put money on him having[r]something to do with Ms. Shiraishi's death.[l][p]
b0_020_0832,That's why he's so scared of being cursed by her.[l][p]
b0_020_0833,I see...[l][p]
b0_020_0834,And also...something tells me he knows more[r]about your son's kidnapping.[l][p]
b0_020_0835,...?[l][p]
b0_020_0836,In any case, I think I've got a good idea of what he's[r]hiding. Call it a hunch.[l][p]
b0_020_0837,A hunch?[l][p]
b0_020_0838,Well, more of a theory.[l][p]
b0_020_0839,Care to take a guess?[l][p]
b0_020_0840,I can't say for certain, but...[l][p]
b0_020_0841,What if...[%7] [%8][r][%9]...?[l][p]
b0_020_0842,What do you think?[l][p]
b0_020_0843,You mean...it was self-inflicted?[r]Hmm...[l][p]
b0_020_0844,Seemed to me that he was more scared of[r]what someone else might do.[l][p]
b0_020_0845,He did mention he was scared of that...[r]but it doesn't tell us anything new.[l][p]
b0_020_0846,So you think she killed herself.[r]But I wonder if that's all there is to it...[l][p]
b0_020_0847,Interesting. That's what he claimed was[r]going on...but I wonder about that.[l][p]
b0_020_0848,I see. So you think Ms. Shiraishi's death might[r]not have been suicide.[l][p]
b0_020_0849,That would certainly give him a good reason[r]to think she'd hold a grudge...[r]but I'm not sure I buy it.[l][p]
b0_020_0850,Exactly my thinking.[l][p]
b0_020_0851,Jonouchi knew about Ms. Shiraishi's connection[r]to the kidnapping...[l][p]
b0_020_0852,and he used that to blackmail her into doing[r]his bidding.[l][p]
b0_020_0853,He made her feel so trapped, she took her own[r]life to escape. That's my read on it.[l][p]
b0_020_0854,How despicable.[l][p]
b0_020_0855,Well, it's just a theory.[l][p]
b0_020_0856,Hmm... That might be a little bit far-fetched.[l][p]
b0_020_0857,I see. I'm sorry if I disappointed you.[l][p]
b0_020_0858,I'm not really cut out to play detective.[l][p]
b0_020_0859,Well, no point dwelling on speculation. The[r]truth will out in time.[l][p]
b0_020_0860,I'm just an ordinary housewife. I'm not clever[r]enough for all this.[l][p]
b0_020_0861,Are you sure? I'd had you down for sharper[r]than that.[l][p]
b0_020_0862,That's flattering, but I'm afraid you're mistaken.[l][p]
b0_020_0863,Anyway, that's enough speculation for now.[r]The truth will out in time.[l][p]
b0_020_0864,Right now, I think we need to have another[r]chat with Mr. Jonouchi.[l][p]
b0_020_0865,...[l][p]
b0_020_0866,Is something wrong?[l][p]
b0_020_0867,Not really. It just struck me, it's been[r]twenty years since the Nejima Murders.[l][p]
b0_020_0868,So it has.[l][p]
b0_020_0869,Not to spook you or anything, but I thought[r]you might be interested in knowing...[l][p]
b0_020_0870,Hm...?[l][p]
b0_020_0871,Life in prison doesn't always mean life.[l][p]
b0_020_0872,There's precedent for first-time offenders[r]being allowed out on parole after twenty years.[l][p]
b0_020_0873,Only if they're found to show remorse and the[r]desire to reform themselves, of course.[l][p]
b0_020_0874,That's right. I'm impressed you know so much.[l][p]
b0_020_0875,Still, it's hard for someone with a criminal[r]record to re-integrate into society.[l][p]
b0_020_0876,I hear they've been trying to fix that recently,[r]matching inmates with jobs and accommodation.[l][p]
b0_020_0877,Oh, really?[l][p]
b0_020_0878,They keep an eye on them, of course,[r]and make them report in for regular checkups.[l][p]
b0_020_0879,But to avoid discrimination, they keep the[r]inmates' records a secret from everyone but[r]their employers.[l][p]
b0_020_0880,They even give particularly notorious criminals[r][c3]new identities[c0] so they won't be recognized in[r]the workplace.[l][p]
b0_020_0881,My.[l][p]
b0_020_0882,The way you put it...[l][p]
b0_020_0883,It's like you're saying Fumichika Nejima could[r]be out on parole right now...[l][p]
b0_020_0884,back in society under a new name, with[r]nobody any the wiser.[l][p]
b0_020_0885,It's possible.[l][p]
b0_020_0886,As it happens, a little birdy told me about a[r]big name making parole a few months back.[l][p]
b0_020_0887,I don't know if that was Nejima...[l][p]
b0_020_0888,but our discussion just now did bring it to mind.[l][p]
b0_020_0889,I see.[l][p]
b0_020_0890,How unsettling.[l][p]
b0_020_0891,Now that you mention it...[l][p]
b0_020_0892,I just remembered something too.[l][p]
b0_020_0893,What was it?[l][p]
b0_020_0894,I was passing Komagata High School a little[r]while ago when I saw someone.[l][p]
b0_020_0895,A [c3]janitor[c0], I think, and I could have[r]sworn he reminded me of Fumichika Nejima.
b0_020_0896,Oh?[l][p]
b0_020_0897,He looked a little different after twenty years.[l][p]
b0_020_0898,Much thinner than I remembered, too. I told[r]myself I was just seeing things.[l][p]
b0_020_0899,But perhaps...[l][p]
b0_020_0900,Perhaps it was him after all.[l][p]
b0_020_0901,...[l][p]
b0_020_0902,<i>Standing around is the last thing I want to[r]be doing right now.[l][p]
b0_020_0903,<i>This is my only chance to bring back my son.[r]I can't afford to fritter it away.[l][p]
b0_020_0904,So.[l][p]
b0_020_0905,What next?[l][p]
b0_020_0906,The big question now is what the rest of the[r]curse bearers are up to.[l][p]
b0_020_0907,Luckily, the Sumida River is a good distance[r]from any of the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
b0_020_0908,It's unlikely the other curse bearers will come all[r]the way here. I can finally have a[r]moment to think.[l][p]
b0_020_0909,I see...[l][p]
b0_020_0910,All right.[l][p]
b0_020_0911,You cannot currently progress any further.[r]Once your situation has changed, select [c3]Resume[c0] to try again.[r]Pressing Suspend will return you to the Story Chart.
b0_020_0912,Excuse me?
b0_020_0913,Hm...?[l][p]
b0_020_0914,It's been a while since someone spooked me[r]like that.[l][p]
b0_020_0915,Where did she come from?[r]It's like she appeared out of nowhere.[l][p]
b0_020_0916,I didn't mean to startle you.[l][p]
b0_020_0917,I'm terribly sorry if I've gotten the wrong[r]people, but...would you happen to be curse bearers?[l][p]
b0_020_0918,...![l][p]
b0_020_0919,Curse bearers? What's that, then?[l][p]
b0_020_0920,Erm... It means someone who's gathering[r]souls for the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
b0_020_0921,You have heard of the Rite of Resurrection,[r]haven't you? Everybody's talking about it.[l][p]
b0_020_0922,Color me intrigued. Care to tell me more,[r] Miss... What was your name again?[l][p]
b0_020_0923,Oh, silly me. I'm [c4]Ayame Tono[c0].[l][p]

b0_020_0926,That girl gives me the creeps.[r]What's her deal?[l][p]
b0_020_0927,<i>Is that...a woman's voice? Who could it be?[l][p]
b0_020_0928,!
b0_020_0929,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori18 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #18[c0] discovered!
b0_020_0930,There's more to the Rite of Resurrection than[r]meets the eye, you see...[l][p]
b0_020_0931,So the best way to collect soul dregs is to[r]kill other curse bearers.[l][p]
b0_020_0932,And that's about the size of it.[r]I hope it wasn't too much to follow...[l][p]
b0_020_0933,No, no, I think I got the gist.[r]Funny old world we live in, huh?[l][p]
b0_020_0934,So, are you saying you're one of these[r]curse bearers?[l][p]
b0_020_0935,No. Well, not quite... It's complicated. I'm[r]not, but Yutaro is.[l][p]
b0_020_0936,Yutaro? Is that your boyfriend?[l][p]
b0_020_0937,Oh, heavens no, just a friend. His full name is[r]Yutaro Namigaki. We're...I suppose you could say[r]partners in crime.[l][p]
b0_020_0938,Funny way of putting it.[l][p]
b0_020_0939,So where is this Yutaro now?[l][p]
b0_020_0940,Well, about that... He's not actually a curse[r]bearer anymore.[l][p]
b0_020_0941,He's more like a former curse bearer.[l][p]
b0_020_0942,Former? How so?[l][p]
b0_020_0943,I don't really know the details myself, but[r]apparently, he lost his curse stone.[l][p]
b0_020_0944,Typical, right? He makes such a show of being[r]a top student, only to flunk where it counts.[l][p]
b0_020_0945,So now I'm out here looking for curse bearers[r]myself. If you want something done right...[l][p]
b0_020_0946,He...lost it? How did he do that?[l][p]
b0_020_0947,I wasn't with him at the time, so I don't[r]know exactly what happened.[l][p]
b0_020_0948,All I know is that he came back saying he[r]didn't have it anymore.[l][p]
b0_020_0949,Although...well...[l][p]
b0_020_0950,It's strange that you'd probe into that[r]of all things.[l][p]
b0_020_0951,I'm just the curious sort, that's all. Sorry[r]if it's a touchy subject.[l][p]
b0_020_0952,Oh, I don't mind. I don't particularly care[r]about keeping it a secret.[l][p]
b0_020_0953,Yutaro can be a little irrational sometimes, so I[r]have to keep a level head on my shoulders.[l][p]
b0_020_0954,So what are you trying to do with this Rite[r]of Resurrection?[l][p]
b0_020_0955,Well, Yutaro has his own plan all laid out.[l][p]
b0_020_0956,I don't know if I can get behind it, though.[r]It seems...how do I put it? Self-centered?[l][p]
b0_020_0957,I mean, if you've got a chance to resurrect the[r]dead, it would be a waste not to use it on[r]someone that really matters, right?[l][p]
b0_020_0958,So I was planning to steal his curse stone at[r]the last second and use it for myself.[l][p]
b0_020_0959,...![l][p]
b0_020_0960,Well, until he lost it, anyway.[l][p]
b0_020_0961,Oh, but don't tell Yutaro I was going to do that,[r]okay? I don't think he'd be happy[r]to hear it.[l][p]
b0_020_0962,Of course. Keeping secrets is my business.[l][p]
b0_020_0963,My, aren't you dashing![l][p]
b0_020_0964,...[l][p]
b0_020_0965,Sounds like you really have your heart set on this[r]rite. What were you hoping to use it on?[l][p]
b0_020_0966,...Do you promise you won't laugh?[l][p]
b0_020_0967,Cross my heart.[l][p]
b0_020_0968,Well then, let me tell you my master plan![r]Prepare to be amazed![l][p]
b0_020_0969,Ahem...[l][p]
b0_020_0970,I'm an art student, you see. Woodblock prints[r]are my specialty, ukiyo-e in particular.[l][p]
b0_020_0971,Ukiyo-e, huh? You must be a cultured lady.[l][p]
b0_020_0972,Really? Do you think so? Everybody says[r]it's a strange interest for a girl to have...[l][p]
b0_020_0973,You know, people often think of ukiyo-e as[r]some inaccessible, high-class art form...[r]but that's actually totally untrue![l][p]
b0_020_0974,Back in the Edo period, it was the art for the[r]masses. Amusement for the common people.[l][p]
b0_020_0975,So when you think about it, we feel exactly the[r]same thrills from every brushstroke as they did[r]back then! Isn't that fascinating?[l][p]
b0_020_0976,Huh... Yeah, I guess.[l][p]
b0_020_0977,And as far as I'm concerned, the undisputed king[r]of ukiyo-e is the one and only [c4]Hokusai[c0]![l][p]
b0_020_0978,Have you heard of him?[l][p]
b0_020_0979,Sure I have. He's famous. Didn't he live somewhere[r]around here, back in the Edo period?[l][p]
b0_020_0980,That's right! You're just as knowledgeable as[r]you look![l][p]
b0_020_0981,His Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji are so iconic,[r]they're the only works of his most people know...[l][p]
b0_020_0982,but Hokusai was soooooo much more than just[r]mountains and waves![l][p]
b0_020_0983,That's only the teeny-tiny tip of a veritable[r]iceberg of work![l][p]
b0_020_0984,I've gotta admit, I only really know him[r]from those landscapes myself.[l][p]
b0_020_0985,Oh, don't worry about it. Anyone can learn![l][p]
b0_020_0986,When Hokusai died at the age of ninety, he left[r]behind over thirty thousand drawings.[l][p]
b0_020_0987,That's multiple drawings a day for eighty years![r]Amazing, right?[l][p]
b0_020_0988,So he kept on drawing right up into his old[r]age, huh? Impressive.[l][p]
b0_020_0989,But even in his final years, he was never[r]satisfied with his own work.[l][p]
b0_020_0990,His dying words were [c3]"Should heaven afford me[r]but five more years, I shall finally become[r]a true artist[c0]."[l][p]
b0_020_0991,Even on his deathbed, he still thought[r]he had more to learn![l][p]
b0_020_0992,He was already the greatest painter and artist[r]of his era. Who knows what he could have done[r]with more time?[l][p]
b0_020_0993,Well, that's what I want to find out![l][p]
b0_020_0994,Hm...?[l][p]
b0_020_0995,Hold on. Are you saying...?[l][p]
b0_020_0996,Besides, he always said he wanted to move out of[r]a hundred houses, but he only made it to[r]ninety-three. Isn't that just tragic?[l][p]
b0_020_0997,Oh no. Nuh-uh.[l][p]
b0_020_0998,No way this is going where I think it's going.[l][p]
b0_020_0999,Imagine the masterpieces he could create with[r]modern techniques! I feel all dizzy just thinking[r]about it![l][p]
b0_020_1000,...You've gotta be kidding me.[l][p]
b0_020_1001,So, if I understand correctly...[r]you want to use the Rite of Resurrection to...[l][p]
b0_020_1002,That's right![r]I want to bring Hokusai back to life![l][p]
b0_020_1003,...Well. That's certainly a...novel idea.[l][p]
b0_020_1004,...[l][p]
b0_020_1005,<i>That's what she'd use it on? What a waste.[l][p]
b0_020_1006,I'm sure Yutaro would laugh if he heard this,[r]but I'm totally serious![l][p]
b0_020_1007,I'm making the Hokusai Revival Project happen![r]It'll be a national sensation![l][p]
b0_020_1008,So, anyway... Mind if I ask why you thought I[r]was a curse bearer?[l][p]
b0_020_1009,Oh, that! I'm terribly sorry, I was so rude.[l][p]
b0_020_1010,I saw the two of you out late at night, and I[r]suppose I made assumptions.[l][p]
b0_020_1011,Gotcha. Sorry if we gave you the wrong idea.[l][p]
b0_020_1012,Out of interest... What was your plan if we did[r]turn out to be curse bearers?[l][p]
b0_020_1013,Great question! And the answer is...I was going[r]to ask you very nicely for your curse stones![l][p]
b0_020_1014,And you thought we'd have given them to you?[r]Just like that?[l][p]
b0_020_1015,Well, maybe not. But you know what they say![r]You never know until you ask![l][p]
b0_020_1016,You must really love your boyfriend if you're[r]willing to try something that risky.[l][p]
b0_020_1017,Oh, goodness no. We're just friends.[l][p]
b0_020_1018,My life doesn't revolve around him, you know![l][p]
b0_020_1019,Anyway, you aren't curse bearers, so I'm just[r]bothering you, aren't I? Please, ignore me![l][p]
b0_020_1020,I should ask her what her deal is.[l][p]
b0_020_1021,She says her name's Ayame.[r]I'd guess she's around twenty.[l][p]
b0_020_1022,She must be brave, walking around alone this[r]late...or maybe there's more to it.[l][p]
b0_020_1023,He's hiding it well, but I can sense that he's[r]got his guard up.[l][p]
b0_020_1024,Could there be more to this girl than meets[r]the eye?[l][p]
b0_020_1025,<i>She certainly had no reservations telling us[r]about the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
b0_020_1026,<i>It'll be worth keeping an eye on her.[r]She could be trouble.[l][p]
b0_020_1027,<i>Ah... That must be it.[l][p]
b0_020_1028,<i>She must be half of the young couple[r]Richter mentioned.[l][p]
b0_020_1029,<i>But she isn't a curse bearer herself, and her[r]friend has lost his curse stone.[l][p]
b0_020_1030,<i>Neither of them will be of use to me.[l][p]
b0_020_1031,Oh, gosh, is that the time? I should be going.[l][p]
b0_020_1032,I need to get my hands on a curse bearer[r]before daybreak.[l][p]
b0_020_1033,Sorry for flagging you down out of the blue[r]like that! Best of luck![l][p]
b0_020_1034,...[l][p]
b0_020_1035,Well. There goes trouble.[l][p]
b0_020_1036,If we're going after curse stones, we should[r]keep an eye on her. Two if we can.[l][p]
b0_020_1037,Why do you say that?[l][p]
b0_020_1038,Before she left, she wished us "best of luck."[l][p]
b0_020_1039,She's got at least an inkling that we're[r]curse bearers.[l][p]
b0_020_1040,My...[l][p]
b0_020_1041,There's a good chance we'll clash sooner or[r]later. We're after the same thing, after all.[l][p]
b0_020_1042,You head on back to the mansion, ma'am. [r]I think I'll tail her for a while.[l][p]

c0_010_0762,The other officers have all gone home.[r]It's just us now.[l][p]
c0_010_0763,The park should be able to open back up tomorrow[r]like nothing ever happened![l][p]

c0_010_0778,We've gotta be open-minded. What if that's how[r]policework is gonna be from now on?[l][p]
c0_010_0779,Don't make me laugh.[l][p]
c0_010_0780,Listen up, Erio.[l][p]
c0_010_0781,You can't go blaming the death of your buddy[r]on something like the occult.[l][p]
c0_010_0782,...[l][p]
c0_010_0783,I don't care if it was ghosts or the occult[r]or what.[l][p]
c0_010_0784,Whoever or whatever it was that did this...[l][p]
c0_010_0785,I'll get them... I promise you that![l][p]
c0_010_0786,Well, you've got the right attitude, but...[r]we don't even know if this is a murder yet.[l][p]
c0_010_0787,Biases weaken our judgement. Get too fixated[r]on one thing and you stop seeing everything else.[l][p]
c0_010_0788,Aye, aye, Boss![l][p]
c0_010_0789,So... Now that we've finished investigating[r]the scene, let's review what we know![l][p]
c0_010_0790,Hm? Now? It's getting late. I figured we'd[r]head straight home from here.[l][p]
c0_010_0791,Come on! We've got to go over all the info[r]we've gathered![l][p]
c0_010_0792,And what better place to do that than here at[r]the scene of the crime where we can soak up[r]the atmosphere?[l][p]
c0_010_0793,Soak up the atmosphere!? The hell is there[r]to soak up!?[l][p]
c0_010_0794,You must be really into this occult stuff if[r]you get off on being in a place like this.[l][p]
c0_010_0795,Wait... You mean being somewhere like this[r]doesn't get your blood pumping...? No way...[l][p]
c0_010_0796,No, no. Don't turn this around on me.[r]I'm not the weird one here. Cripes.[l][p]
c0_010_0797,Ugh, fine... Let's get this over with.[l][p]
c0_010_0798,Aye, aye, Boss![l][p]
c0_010_0799,The Former Yasuda Gardens here in Yokoami Ichome[r]were originally built as part of a daimyo's[r]estate back in the Edo period.[l][p]
c0_010_0800,The park became city property a number of[r]years ago and underwent extensive renovations.[l][p]
c0_010_0801,There's not a soul around at this time of night...[r]Quiet doesn't even begin to describe it.[l][p]
c0_010_0802,All I can hear is the rustling of leaves.[r]That, and my own voice.[l][p]
c0_010_0803,Jun Erio. A detective in the Tokyo Metropolitan[r]Police Department, First Investigative Division.[r]His rank is sergeant.[l][p]
c0_010_0804,This is his first time leading a case. It's like[r]he's graduated from rookie to newbie.[l][p]
c0_010_0805,He looks put together on the outside, but acts[r]like a kid most of the time. Honestly... The force[r]could use more people like him.[l][p]
c0_010_0806,This is where the victim was found. It's...[r]Well, it's clean now.[l][p]
c0_010_0807,It almost feels like nothing happened here[r]at all...[l][p]
c0_010_0808,But once an incident like this has come to pass,[r]there's no going back.[l][p]
c0_010_0809,Not that knowing that is any consolation.[l][p]
c0_010_0810,This pond... They say it used to flow into[r]the Sumida River.[l][p]
c0_010_0811,But the river became so polluted that they[r]cut it off.[l][p]
c0_010_0812,So, early in the morning yesterday...[l][p]
c0_010_0813,A staff member found the victim collapsed here[r]in the park, and called the police when they[r]realized he was dead.[l][p]
c0_010_0814,While there were no obvious external wounds...[l][p]
c0_010_0815,The fact that he was a police officer, and the[r]evidence of a struggle, means it's likely that[r]this was a murder.[l][p]
c0_010_0816,The Sumida office sent it over to us since it[r]involved the death of an officer, and we were[r]tasked with the investigation.[l][p]
c0_010_0817,What we need to do is figure out what happened[r]and whether there was foul play involved.[l][p]
c0_010_0818,...I think that about sums things up.[l][p]
c0_010_0819,But, uh...Boss?[l][p]
c0_010_0820,Yeah?[l][p]
c0_010_0821,Is this case really important enough to assign[r]to someone from the Investigation Division?[l][p]
c0_010_0822,I mean, a friend of mine died, so it's important[r]to me, but...[l][p]
c0_010_0823,It's all up to the higher-ups...[r]I'm sure they've got their reasons.[l][p]
c0_010_0824,Boss. You know something, don't you?[l][p]
c0_010_0825,It'll all become clear in time.[r]Try not to worry about it too much.[l][p]
c0_010_0826,...[l][p]
c0_010_0827,Thinking about it...[l][p]
c0_010_0828,The only thing we know for sure is the identity[r]of the victim.[l][p]
c0_010_0829,That means there must have been something[r]special about him, right?[l][p]
c0_010_0830,...[l][p]
c0_010_0831,Maybe...maybe he knew something he wasn't[r]supposed to—some kind of secret or something...[l][p]
c0_010_0832,Isn't that right?[l][p]
c0_010_0833,You're pretty sharp sometimes, you know that?[l][p]
c0_010_0834,If you've picked up on that, you should be able[r]to put the rest together yourself.[l][p]
c0_010_0835,Hmm...[l][p]
c0_010_0836,Well, it is our duty to get to the bottom of a[r]suspicious death. Especially one involving an officer.[l][p]
c0_010_0837,The victim is [c4]Hajime Yoshimi[c0] of the Juvenile[r]Division of the Sumida City Community Safety[r]Bureau. Twenty-seven years old. Single.[l][p]
c0_010_0838,He mostly dealt with cases involving juveniles[r]and education. His rank was Senior Police Officer.[l][p]
c0_010_0839,You knew him well, didn'tcha? What was he like?[l][p]
c0_010_0840,Yes, we were in the academy together. We still[r]went out for drinks together every month or two.[l][p]
c0_010_0841,He could be a little rowdy, but he was like a[r]big brother to us all. He was kind, and cared[r]about his friends.[l][p]
c0_010_0842,For better or worse, he wasn't the uptight type[r]of cop. The man always showed empathy, and I[r]heard he was popular with the locals for it.[l][p]
c0_010_0843,He treated each and every troubled kid he met[r]with compassion. He had a great track record[r]when it came to rehabilitation.[l][p]
c0_010_0844,Sounds like we lost a good one.[l][p]
c0_010_0845,Yes. We did... We truly did.[l][p]
c0_010_0846,I knew being a cop was dangerous. I knew[r]something like this could happen, but...[l][p]
c0_010_0847,It's never easy when it happens for real.[r]I know the feeling.[l][p]
c0_010_0848,He didn't seem to care much about climbing[r]the ranks, but he was at the top of our class.[l][p]
c0_010_0849,Only problem was that he took on so much, he[r]had the most unfinished paperwork, too.[l][p]
c0_010_0850,I always felt we'd need an unusual guy like him[r]to help us solve all our unusual cases...[l][p]
c0_010_0851,...[l][p]
c0_010_0852,Don't worry. You're plenty unusual yourself.[l][p]
c0_010_0853,Me? I was the most normal of my classmates.[l][p]
c0_010_0854,Besides... The real weirdo among us quit the[r]academy a long time ago.[l][p]
c0_010_0855,There was one even weirder than you?[l][p]
c0_010_0856,Hajime was quite the bad boy in school, apparently.[r]He ended up with the police a lot.[l][p]
c0_010_0857,He said the officer in charge was good to him,[r]helped him get back on track.[l][p]
c0_010_0858,The reason he wanted to become a cop was to pay[r]his kindness forward. Said it was the first[r]time he ever took his studies seriously.[l][p]
c0_010_0859,That's a good story. Love that kind of thing.[r]Makes me wanna have a drink in his honor.[l][p]
c0_010_0860,Please don't make fun of my dead friend.[l][p]
c0_010_0861,Hey, I said in his honor. You should aspire to[r]become the kind of cop people miss when they[r]die in the field.[l][p]
c0_010_0862,You say that like it's a sure thing I'll die.[l][p]
c0_010_0863,Besides, if I end up biting it, I'm sure[r]you'll be the one who misses me most, Boss.[l][p]
c0_010_0864,Eh...[l][p]
c0_010_0865,Come on, don't be like that...[r]You'll hurt morale.[l][p]
c0_010_0866,Well, I guess how much I'll miss you depends on[r]how this investigation goes.[l][p]
c0_010_0867,I can already see it! "Eriooo! Nooo![r]Why'd you have to go and get yourself killed!?"[l][p]
c0_010_0868,I have no idea what's going on in that head[r]of yours.[l][p]
c0_010_0869,Yeah, that'll be a sight to see. I can't wait![l][p]
c0_010_0870,You can't wait for your own death?[r]Get it together, kid.[l][p]
c0_010_0871,Sheesh. You really are something.[l][p]
c0_010_0872,...Thank you?[l][p]
c0_010_0873,What about the victim's family?[l][p]
c0_010_0874,The Yoshimi family is from Kitasenju in Adachi City,[r]but Hajime's parents died a long time ago.[l][p]
c0_010_0875,He lived there all alone.[r]No siblings or anything.[l][p]
c0_010_0876,I went to his house a few times for drinks.[r]I was surprised—it's this huge, old-looking place.[l][p]
c0_010_0877,Like, you know... The kind of place that seems[r]super haunted.[l][p]
c0_010_0878,And he lived there alone?[l][p]
c0_010_0879,It looked like the home of an old noble family.[r]It was hard to imagine him being such a[r]delinquent living in a house like that.[l][p]
c0_010_0880,There's that bias I was talking about.[l][p]
c0_010_0881,If he's from an old family, I'm sure things[r]were complicated.[l][p]
c0_010_0882,That's a bias, too.[l][p]
c0_010_0883,He never talked about any of that, even when[r]we were drunk, so I don't know much about it.[l][p]
c0_010_0884,Hmm...[l][p]
c0_010_0885,Oh, one more thing.[l][p]
c0_010_0886,Yeah?[l][p]
c0_010_0887,Hajime was [c3]engaged[c0].[l][p]
c0_010_0888,He'd been seeing his fiancée ever since they were[r]in school. Over ten years. They'd just started[r]talking about getting married.[l][p]
c0_010_0889,What was her name again...?[l][p]
c0_010_0890,He showed me a picture once...[r]She was a beautiful woman.[l][p]
c0_010_0891,That so. How terrible for her.[l][p]
c0_010_0892,But she may know if there'd been anything going[r]on with him lately. We should speak to her.[l][p]
c0_010_0893,Yeah. His fiancée may have been his only confidant.[l][p]
c0_010_0894,I'm sure someone at the Sumida Police Department[r]has already contacted her. I'll look into it[r]tomorrow.[l][p]
c0_010_0895,Ah... Hey, Boss?[l][p]
c0_010_0896,I looked into the case that Hajime was running.[l][p]
c0_010_0897,Oh, great. That's the kind of stuff I want to[r]know.[l][p]
c0_010_0898,What was Hajime working on the day he died?[l][p]
c0_010_0899,Well...[l][p]
c0_010_0900,According to his report from the day before,[r]he had [c3]two cases involving juveniles[c0].[l][p]
c0_010_0901,Uh-huh.[l][p]
c0_010_0902,The first was the suicide of a high school girl[r]who jumped off a building in Kamezawa last week.[l][p]
c0_010_0903,Ah, yeah... I did hear about that.[l][p]
c0_010_0904,The girl's name was [c4]Michiyo Shiraishi[c0]. She was[r]a second-year student at Komagata High School.[l][p]
c0_010_0905,But it seems as though Hajime had had contact[r]with her even before this incident.[l][p]
c0_010_0906,Hmm. So she'd been troubled for some time.[l][p]
c0_010_0907,That's the thing...[l][p]
c0_010_0908,About a month ago, he happened to see her[r]walking around town. She looked upset, so he[r]struck up a conversation with her.[l][p]
c0_010_0909,He was sure there was something bothering her,[r]but she wouldn't tell him what.[l][p]
c0_010_0910,Must've been trouble at home.[l][p]
c0_010_0911,That's what he thought too. It seems he visited[r]her home and spoke to her parents, but...[l][p]
c0_010_0912,They said there was no problem, so there was[r]nothing else he could do.[l][p]
c0_010_0913,And now she's dead...[l][p]
c0_010_0914,Hmm... Then it's possible he could have prevented[r]her suicide then.[l][p]
c0_010_0915,He must have been devastated.[l][p]
c0_010_0916,And that's why he was looking into this[r]Michiyo Shiraishi again.[l][p]
c0_010_0917,He must have thought that something terrible[r]had happened that drove her to end her life.[l][p]
c0_010_0918,But ultimately, he never reported the findings[r]of his investigation.[l][p]
c0_010_0919,I see... And you're thinking that it may have[r]had something to do with his death.[l][p]
c0_010_0920,We'll have to find out what it is Hajime[r]discovered.[l][p]
c0_010_0921,Right. Let's check with the Sumida Police[r]Department about that tomorrow, too.[l][p]
c0_010_0922,And what was the other case he was working?[l][p]
c0_010_0923,This one...is also related to a Komagata High[r]student.[l][p]
c0_010_0924,A troublemaker named [c4]Hitomi Okuda[c0]. She seems[r]to be the leader of a group of kids who get[r]up to no good.[l][p]
c0_010_0925,Hmph. Juvenile delinquency. Fun.[l][p]
c0_010_0926,She was pretty bad for a while. Multiple charges[r]of destruction of property, assault and battery,[r]you name it.[l][p]
c0_010_0927,Hajime had been working with her for about six[r]months, and she was finally starting to open up.[l][p]
c0_010_0928,Then...he met with the girl the day he died.[l][p]
c0_010_0929,Well, every school's got its problems...[l][p]
c0_010_0930,But I'm sure he'd be worried about how she'd[r]get on without him.[l][p]
c0_010_0931,Right. Just when she'd finally found an adult[r]she could trust...[l][p]
c0_010_0932,She might act out without someone to help her[r]get through this.[l][p]
c0_010_0933,We'll have to make sure the Sumida Community[r]Safety Bureau does their job.[l][p]
c0_010_0934,But...[l][p]
c0_010_0935,Hm?[l][p]
c0_010_0936,We can't rule out the possibility that meeting[r]with this delinquent girl had something to do[r]with his death.[l][p]
c0_010_0937,Then we'll have to interview her, too.[l][p]
c0_010_0938,Ah... Yes, you're right.[l][p]
c0_010_0939,She may have been the last person to see him[r]alive, after all.[l][p]
c0_010_0940,I'll ask Sumida to introduce us tomorrow.[l][p]
c0_010_0941,Though... Who knows if they'll actually let us[r]talk with her.[l][p]
c0_010_0942,That's what we hired you for. Lay a little[r]boyish charm on them if they need convincing.[l][p]
c0_010_0943,Ahh... Yeah, I'm sure they'd prefer me over a[r]scary-looking old man like you, Boss.[l][p]
c0_010_0944,Watch it. I'm still your superior. You oughta[r]act like you respect me, at least.[l][p]
c0_010_0945,Oh... I thought I was...[l][p]
c0_010_0946,You were? Shit, is that just how your generation[r]speaks? You really are a new breed.[l][p]
c0_010_0947,Eh. It's probably just me, actually.[l][p]
c0_010_0948,Ah. Well, don't think you can get away with that[r]with other people.[l][p]
c0_010_0949,...So anyways, Boss.[l][p]
c0_010_0950,Were you even listening!?[l][p]
c0_010_0951,We've got quite a bit to look into tomorrow.[l][p]
c0_010_0952,First, the two Komagata High School cases that[r]Hajime was handling.[l][p]
c0_010_0953,And we need to speak with his fiancée as well.[r]I believe that's it for tomorrow.[l][p]
c0_010_0954,As for the cause of death, we won't know until[r]the autopsy is done.[l][p]
c0_010_0955,From what we've seen, though, it'd appear to be[r]some kind of acute heart failure.[l][p]
c0_010_0956,But since he had no record of chronic illness,[r]and had no visible wounds, it's possible that[r]poison or drugs could've been involved.[l][p]
c0_010_0957,Dying in the middle of the park like that...[r]It certainly seems suspicious.[l][p]
c0_010_0958,We found signs of a struggle at the scene,[r]as well as footprints belonging to an[r]unidentified individual.[l][p]
c0_010_0959,We've got people trying to identify those prints.[l][p]
c0_010_0960,If we can find who they belong to...we might[r]be able to figure this whole thing out.[l][p]
c0_010_0961,Yes, wouldn't that be nice if that were the[r]end of it?[l][p]
c0_010_0962,The only things Hajime had on him were his[r]badge and his wallet in his pockets.[l][p]
c0_010_0963,So we can rule out a mugging.[l][p]
c0_010_0964,Though there probably aren't many people who'd[r]think to try mugging a cop as big as him.[l][p]
c0_010_0965,I've also heard that Hajime got into a fair few[r]fights in his younger days.[l][p]
c0_010_0966,He started judo once he became an officer and[r]rose up the ranks quickly.[l][p]
c0_010_0967,Sounds like the perp would have to have been[r]pretty strong to take on Hajime.[l][p]
c0_010_0968,Time of death was around 11 p.m. two days ago.[r]Outside of the park's operating hours, of course.[l][p]
c0_010_0969,His body was found early in the morning yesterday.[l][p]
c0_010_0970,11 p.m. the day before yesterday...[l][p]
c0_010_0971,What was Hajime doing out here at that time[r]in the first place?[l][p]
c0_010_0972,That's the question, isn't it?[l][p]
c0_010_0973,The entrance to the park is closed after hours,[r]but it's a small gate that'd be fairly easy for[r]him to get through if he really wanted to.[l][p]
c0_010_0974,That would, of course, be breaking and[r]entering, but... What do you think, Boss?[l][p]
c0_010_0975,It's hard to imagine a cop like Hajime would[r]trespass for no reason.[l][p]
c0_010_0976,And since it seems like someone else was here[r]with him... Could they have called him here?[l][p]
c0_010_0977,Oh! That does seem likely.[l][p]
c0_010_0978,Maybe he came here under the cover of night...[r]to hide something?[l][p]
c0_010_0979,I don't know... Why go through all that trouble[r]just to hide something?[l][p]
c0_010_0980,To be perfectly honest... I think you're going[r]the wrong direction entirely.[l][p]
c0_010_0981,...Hmph. You think?[l][p]
c0_010_0982,Since it seems like there was another person[r]here at the time of Hajime's death...[l][p]
c0_010_0983,Wouldn't it be more likely that that other[r]person called him here?[l][p]
c0_010_0984,Hmm, yeah. Let's go with that.[l][p]
c0_010_0985,They must have been talking about something pretty[r]sensitive to come here in the middle of the night.[l][p]
c0_010_0986,So Hajime met someone here to discuss[r]something in secret...[l][p]
c0_010_0987,And then...they got into a fight?[l][p]
c0_010_0988,No, that wouldn't match the cause of death.[r]There were no wounds on the body that would[r]indicate a spontaneous scuffle.[l][p]
c0_010_0989,The perp must've planned something.[l][p]
c0_010_0990,Then you think it was meditated?[r]That would mean...[l][p]
c0_010_0991,They called Hajime to the park with the intent[r]to kill him?
c0_010_0992,Well... There is still the possibility that it[r]was just some kind of accident.[l][p]
c0_010_0993,Maybe the perp tried to threaten Hajime and[r]things went south from there.[l][p]
c0_010_0994,We should be able to get a clearer picture[r]once we know exactly what killed him.[l][p]
c0_010_0995,Right...[l][p]
c0_010_0996,I can't help but wonder who it is that was here[r]with him.[l][p]
c0_010_0997,But either way...[l][p]
c0_010_0998,I'm so glad you're back in the First Division,[r]Boss![l][p]
c0_010_0999,I've always admired your work.[r]You were like a god to me![l][p]
c0_010_1000,You were the whole reason I became a detective[r]in the first place![l][p]
c0_010_1001,Ah, yeah... About that...[l][p]
c0_010_1002,People have been saying that ever since you[r]first entered the academy, but...[l][p]
c0_010_1003,Yes! That's because it's true![l][p]
c0_010_1004,I couldn't believe you got transferred out of[r]the First just as I was assigned to it![l][p]
c0_010_1005,So getting to work a case like this now, just[r]the two of us, is a dream come true![l][p]
c0_010_1006,Happy as I am to hear that, uh...[l][p]
c0_010_1007,Well... How should I put it...[l][p]
c0_010_1008,What is it?[l][p]
c0_010_1009,If that's true...I'm not sure you've been showing[r]me the appropriate amount of respect.[l][p]
c0_010_1010,Huh? But I do respect you![r]Don't tell me you're going senile, Boss![l][p]
c0_010_1011,That's exactly what I'm talking about![r]When you run your mouth like that![l][p]
c0_010_1012,It's getting late. You must be sleepy.[l][p]
c0_010_1013,Don't worry, Boss! I'll make sure we get out[r]of here soon![l][p]
c0_010_1014,Yeah, yeah... I get it...[l][p]
c0_010_1015,I've been wowed by your shrewd detecting[r]abilities all day today![l][p]
c0_010_1016,Oh really? Funny, I've been wowed by you too...[l][p]
c0_010_1017,On the topic of family... What's yours like, Boss?[l][p]
c0_010_1018,The hell is wrong with you?[r]Prying into my personal life all of a sudden...[l][p]
c0_010_1019,It's just... I've never heard you talk about them[r]or anything.[l][p]
c0_010_1020,Oh... Are you single?[l][p]
c0_010_1021,Shut it. That's none of your business.[l][p]
c0_010_1022,Well, ever since I joined the force, I've been[r]thinking.[l][p]
c0_010_1023,The department really pressures young officers[r]to get married.[l][p]
c0_010_1024,I wonder why that is...?[r]You don't say anything like that, though.[l][p]
c0_010_1025,How should I know? I caved to the pressure myself[r]and got married twenty-some years ago.[l][p]
c0_010_1026,Huh? So then...[l][p]
c0_010_1027,God, you're relentless. She took our daughter[r]and left four years ago. Thanks for reminding me.[l][p]
c0_010_1028,Oh... I'm sorry.[r]I can't believe she'd give up a guy like you![l][p]
c0_010_1029,Eh... I was never home much. Too focused on work.[l][p]
c0_010_1030,I'd come home late only to get called right back[r]out again. Plus, being a cop is dangerous work.[l][p]
c0_010_1031,I don't blame her for getting fed up with it all.[l][p]
c0_010_1032,How sad... Especially when you're out here[r]putting your life on the line.[l][p]
c0_010_1033,Oh, is that why you transferred out of the First?[l][p]
c0_010_1034,...[l][p]
c0_010_1035,...It was already too late by then.[l][p]
c0_010_1036,You better be careful, Erio.[l][p]
c0_010_1037,You say that, but there's not much I can do,[r]is there? That's the nature of our job.[l][p]
c0_010_1038,There aren't many who can really understand it.[r]Not unless they're involved with policework[r]themselves, or related to someone who is...[l][p]
c0_010_1039,But wait, you have a daughter, Boss?[l][p]
c0_010_1040,You really think I want to talk about her after[r]all that? Have some sense.[l][p]
c0_010_1041,Come on! I promise I don't mean this the way[r]it sounds, but...how old is she?[l][p]
c0_010_1042,Jeez, you don't know when to quit, do you?[r]At least try not to look so intrigued.[l][p]
c0_010_1043,She's...well, she's a bit rough around the edges.[r]I think most men are intimidated by her.[l][p]
c0_010_1044,Last I heard she's living by herself and going[r]to college.[l][p]
c0_010_1045,Wow, a college student! Men love an educated lady.[l][p]
c0_010_1046,Stop that! What kind of cop are you, making[r]baseless assumptions like that?[l][p]
c0_010_1047,She's living on her own, though, huh?[r]You must worry about her.[l][p]
c0_010_1048,Worry? I don't even know where she lives.[l][p]
c0_010_1049,Oh, so she hasn't told you... Probably because[r]she knows you'd follow her around everywhere.[l][p]
c0_010_1050,I would not! ...I don't think.[l][p]
c0_010_1051,Come on, now. We both know that's not true![l][p]
c0_010_1052,Listen here...[l][p]
c0_010_1053,You may look like a mean old man, but you sure[r]have a soft side.[l][p]
c0_010_1054,What!? Is that supposed to be a compliment?[r]I can't keep up with you![l][p]
c0_010_1055,We're done talking about this![l][p]
c0_010_1056,Oh, that reminds me...[l][p]
c0_010_1057,If you got married twenty years ago, it must've[r]been right around the [c4]Nejima Murder[c0].[l][p]
c0_010_1058,You know your history. Yeah, that happened a year[r]or two after our wedding.[l][p]
c0_010_1059,You were the one who arrested the killer, weren't[r]you? We studied that case at the academy![l][p]
c0_010_1060,I was only in elementary school at the time,[r]but I still remember people talking about some[r]dangerous criminal getting arrested.[l][p]
c0_010_1061,All that was just...[l][p]
c0_010_1062,Cracking the case, finding the guy, it was all[r]just happenstance.[l][p]
c0_010_1063,I'd really rather not think about it.[r]It was a disturbing case.[l][p]
c0_010_1064,Did it not make your skin crawl when you learned[r]about it at the academy?[l][p]
c0_010_1065,It did. We were all terrified.[l][p]
c0_010_1066,Sounds about right...[l][p]
c0_010_1067,No one could believe that such a mild-mannered[r]man could have committed such a terrible murder.[l][p]
c0_010_1068,If we had overlooked one little thing, we may[r]never have caught him at all.[l][p]
c0_010_1069,I think I remember hearing there was only one[r]charge brought against him in the end?[l][p]
c0_010_1070,That's right. We didn't have the evidence.[r]I knew there was no way such a meticulously[r]planned crime could have been their first, but...[l][p]
c0_010_1071,We may have stuck Fumichika Nejima in a cell, but[r]it was no victory. He always had the upper hand.[l][p]
c0_010_1072,And all the damage he did to everyone involved...[r]Especially the victim's classmates.[l][p]
c0_010_1073,It's already been twenty years, huh... Goddamn it.[r]This is why I try not to think about it.[l][p]
c0_010_1074,...I'm sorry.[l][p]
c0_010_1075,So um, did you—[l][p]
c0_010_1076,That's enough about me. Let's move on.[l][p]
c0_010_1077,So all this occult stuff...[r]Have you heard about it, Boss?[l][p]
c0_010_1078,What're you talking about?[l][p]
c0_010_1079,This [c3]Rite of Resurrection[c0] thing that everyone's[r]talking about![l][p]
c0_010_1080,No, not you too! I've been hearing about that[r]shit everywhere.[l][p]
c0_010_1081,Oh, you have? That's surprising.[l][p]
c0_010_1082,Who cares what people are talking about?[r]It's got nothing to do with our job.[l][p]
c0_010_1083,But don't you think the occult stuff with this[r]case feels...I don't know, realer somehow?[l][p]
c0_010_1084,The whole thing started right here in Honjo in[r]Sumida City, so I thought that maybe...[l][p]
c0_010_1085,Cut it out. Nothing good can come of getting[r]involved with that rite of whatever or that[r]Record of Fates.[l][p]
c0_010_1086,Sounds like you know all about it![l][p]
c0_010_1087,Boss... Are you secretly into the occult?[l][p]
c0_010_1088,Stop that. Seriously. This isn't a joke.[l][p]
c0_010_1089,I get why you'd be intrigued by something called[r]the Rite of Resurrection after a buddy of yours[r]died, but...[l][p]
c0_010_1090,Bringing the dead back to life... That's the[r]stuff of fantasy. It's not real.[l][p]
c0_010_1091,So don't go hoping for miracles. Got it?[l][p]
c0_010_1092,<i>I've got a bad feeling about this case.[r]And my gut is rarely wrong.[l][p]
c0_010_1093,<i>I knew this would be a treacherous case from[r]the moment we were dragged into it...[l][p]
c0_010_1094,Well, Boss, I think that about does it.[l][p]
c0_010_1095,Right. Let's call it for tonight.[r]I'll see you tomorrow.[l][p]
c0_010_1096,Oh, god! What is that!?[l][p]
c0_010_1097,Huh? Boss? What's wrong?[r]Don't tell me you're going senile![l][p]

c0_020_0775,Okay... So let me get this straight, boss.[l][p]
c0_020_0776,The Rite of Resurrection really exists?[l][p]
c0_020_0777,And to use it, you have to kill people using[r]the power of curses from the Seven Mysteries[r]of Honjo?[l][p]
c0_020_0778,And the curse you have is from the story of[r][c3]the Evergreen Beech[c0] that's told in this area?[l][p]
c0_020_0779,Is that right?[l][p]
c0_020_0780,Yeah... Pretty much.[l][p]
c0_020_0781,You're quick on the uptake.[l][p]
c0_020_0782,You weren't your usual silly self when you were[r]explaining, so I knew you were telling the truth![l][p]
c0_020_0783,I'm never silly.[l][p]
c0_020_0784,The only thing I have trouble believing is that[r]you're taking this occult stuff seriously now.[l][p]
c0_020_0785,I mean, talk about paranormal. I thought you[r]didn't believe in any of that.[l][p]
c0_020_0786,It's not that I don't believe in it...[l][p]
c0_020_0787,My familiarity with it is why I've tried not to[r]get too close.[l][p]
c0_020_0788,Are...are you just being a sore loser?[r]Not used to admitting you were wrong?[l][p]
c0_020_0789,Oh, shut up and listen to me.[r]...No point in trying to hide things anymore.[l][p]
c0_020_0790,We won't get anywhere if you don't understand[r]this. So listen up.[l][p]
c0_020_0791,Please, just listen.[l][p]
c0_020_0792,You don't have to keep saying it. I'm listening.[l][p]
c0_020_0793,We don't have time to waste.[r]We'll talk as we walk.[l][p]
c0_020_0794,Hey...! Hey, wait for me, Boss![l][p]
c0_020_0795,<align="center"><color=#ddd><cspace=0px><font="TELOP">両国橋[x0.3][r]<cspace=0px><font="MAIN">Ryogoku Bridge
c0_020_0796,Uhh... Sorry, I just want to double-check one thing.[l][p]
c0_020_0797,You're telling the truth, right? This isn't a[r]side effect of your senility?[l][p]
c0_020_0798,It's the truth. Not like I can prove it, though.[l][p]
c0_020_0799,He's not stupid, but he sure can be slow sometimes.[l][p]
c0_020_0800,Though I think that positivity of his may come in[r]handy at some point.[l][p]
c0_020_0801,<i>Hmm?[l][p]
c0_020_0802,<i>Someone's watching us.[l][p]
c0_020_0803,<i>Doesn't seem like they're gonna run...[r]Let's just keep an eye on 'em for now.[l][p]
c0_020_0804,I'm sure you already know this, but this is all[r]top secret. No sharing it with anyone.[l][p]
c0_020_0805,Right. You can trust me not to.[l][p]
c0_020_0806,But... No, I just can't believe it.[l][p]
c0_020_0807,I'd heard rumors that you used to be a member of[r]a secret division attached to the Security Bureau.[l][p]
c0_020_0808,I can't believe we actually have a department[r]called [c4]Paranormal Affairs[c0]!
c0_020_0809,Yeah, I'm sure it comes as a shock.[r]I couldn't believe it myself.[l][p]
c0_020_0810,I thought the higher-ups were messing with me.[r]Really had me worried for a while there.[l][p]
c0_020_0811,No, this is incredible![l][p]
c0_020_0812,That's the whole reason I became a cop! I was[r]always fascinated by secret agencies and stuff.[l][p]
c0_020_0813,...You serious?[l][p]
c0_020_0814,But thinking about it, it totally makes sense![r]If curses and spirits really do exist...[l][p]
c0_020_0815,Then of course we'd need a special department [r]to protect citizens from them![l][p]
c0_020_0816,You seem a bit too eager to believe all this...[l][p]
c0_020_0817,And hang on, I thought you joined up because of me?[l][p]
c0_020_0818,Come on, Boss. Do you only have one favorite food?[l][p]
c0_020_0819,You can like more than one thing![l][p]
c0_020_0820,Yeah, yeah, whatever.[l][p]
c0_020_0821,In any case, the official stance is that the[r]supernatural doesn't exist, so Paranormal Affairs[r]operates in secret.[l][p]
c0_020_0822,Still not sure why they stuck me there.[l][p]
c0_020_0823,Those four years, I worked nothing but cases[r]involving the supernatural.[l][p]
c0_020_0824,So...do you...you know. Have it?[l][p]
c0_020_0825,Have what?[l][p]
c0_020_0826,Spirit sense, of course![r]Are you what they call "spiritually gifted"?[l][p]
c0_020_0827,Nope. I've never felt anything at all.[l][p]
c0_020_0828,Even if I did, I'd be a lightweight at best.[r]One beer and I'm down for the count.[l][p]
c0_020_0829,Oh... Huh.[l][p]
c0_020_0830,Is that how people in the field quantify someone's[r]spirit sense? Like how much liquor they can handle?[l][p]
c0_020_0831,Nope, that's just me.[r]Thought it'd help get the point across.[l][p]
c0_020_0832,Oh... Huh.[l][p]
c0_020_0833,Sorry. Seems like I keep disappointing you.[l][p]
c0_020_0834,No, it's not your fault, Boss.[l][p]
c0_020_0835,At the risk of disappointing you yet again,[r]I'll tell you one more thing.[l][p]
c0_020_0836,Spirit sense is usually something you're born[r]with. It's tough to develop it later on.[l][p]
c0_020_0837,What!? So there's no hope for me!?[r]No... Say it isn't so...![l][p]
c0_020_0838,Of course you were interested... Well, you[r]never know. You may have some hidden potential.[l][p]
c0_020_0839,I know there's a high schooler who's got so much[r]spirit sense that she works on the front lines.[l][p]
c0_020_0840,I say work, but she wasn't paid 'cause it was[r]supposedly part of her training.[l][p]
c0_020_0841,Yikes... That seems like it'd be in violation of[r]Article 69 of the Labor Standards Act...[l][p]
c0_020_0842,Wow, you really know the law.[r]...No comment.[l][p]
c0_020_0843,Even the occult field has workers' rights[r]issues, huh...[l][p]
c0_020_0844,So... What do we do now?[l][p]
c0_020_0845,We've got this Rite of Resurrection, and the[r]curse echoes of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo...[l][p]
c0_020_0846,The curses being spread out around the city is,[r]uh, a bit of an emergency.[l][p]
c0_020_0847,It's that bad?[l][p]
c0_020_0848,I'll put it this way: it's like handing out guns[r]all over town.[l][p]
c0_020_0849,Jeez! That's real bad![l][p]
c0_020_0850,It is. So we need to find the source and put a[r]stop to it before something terrible happens.[l][p]
c0_020_0851,Usually that'd be a job for Paranormal Affairs,[r]but...[l][p]
c0_020_0852,I talked to them on our way here.[l][p]
c0_020_0853,The main team is tied up till tomorrow night.[l][p]
c0_020_0854,So, they told me to deal with it myself.[r]Said it'd be fine since I have some experience.[l][p]
c0_020_0855,Huh? Wha—?[l][p]
c0_020_0856,Then that overtime you mentioned means...[l][p]
c0_020_0857,Yep. You're gonna help me. Partner.[l][p]
c0_020_0858,All right! Let's do this![l][p]
c0_020_0859,You seem a bit too eager to dive into all this.[r]You really have no reservations working a case[r]you know nothing about?[l][p]
c0_020_0860,You said this was an emergency![r]I didn't think we had a choice![l][p]
c0_020_0861,I'm just trying to be logical about this, Boss.[l][p]
c0_020_0862,You really are something.[r]It might actually be nice having you around.[l][p]
c0_020_0863,Why thank you![l][p]
c0_020_0864,So... What exactly do we do?[l][p]
c0_020_0865,If these curses are connected to the Seven[r]Mysteries, then the people who have the others[r]should all be here in town.[l][p]
c0_020_0866,Right. If there's seven of them, that means[r]there are six more out there.[l][p]
c0_020_0867,And we have to stop them all before they kill[r]anyone with their curses.[l][p]
c0_020_0868,If we can...we should find and collect all the[r]curse stones.[l][p]
c0_020_0869,But, Boss, from what you said earlier...[l][p]
c0_020_0870,Killing a curse bearer gets you closer to[r]completing the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
c0_020_0871,Won't your life be in danger if they find out[r]you're a curse bearer?[l][p]
c0_020_0872,Pretty much.[l][p]
c0_020_0873,We can't let that happen![l][p]
c0_020_0874,Should you even be out here right now?[l][p]
c0_020_0875,Hiding would only be a waste of time.[l][p]
c0_020_0876,The mystery of the One-Sided Reed is associated[r]with Ryogoku Bridge.[l][p]
c0_020_0877,I was hoping we'd be quick enough to run into[r]the One-Sided Reed's curse bearer...[r]No such luck, it seems.[l][p]
c0_020_0878,Well, if nothing else, maybe word will spread that[r]the cops are on the lookout and people will behave.[l][p]
c0_020_0879,That's putting a lot of trust in whoever these[r]other people are.[l][p]
c0_020_0880,But...it's possible that other curse bearers[r]with the same idea will come here.[l][p]
c0_020_0881,Talk to anyone you see who seems suspicious.[l][p]
c0_020_0882,Urk... That means...someone who may have the[r]power of a curse...[l][p]
c0_020_0883,Understood. In that case...[l][p]
c0_020_0884,Why don't I ask that guy who's been watching us[r]this whole time?[l][p]
c0_020_0885,What do you know, there is someone there...[r]Good luck.[l][p]
c0_020_0886,Ah, you noticed him too? Well, good luck.[l][p]
c0_020_0887,Hey, you there! Sorry to bother you, but I've[r]got some questions. I'm with the police.[l][p]
c0_020_0888,<i>Revealing the existence of a secret department[r]is against the rules. Even to a fellow cop.[l][p]
c0_020_0889,<i>But this is an emergency. I need his help.[r]I'll tell him.[l][p]
c0_020_0890,Thanks for your cooperation.[r]We'll be asking you a few things, Mr...[l][p]
c0_020_0891,[c4]Yutaro Namigaki[c0]. That's your name, correct?[l][p]
c0_020_0892,Uh...yes. I don't mind answering your questions.[l][p]
c0_020_0893,You're a detective? Did something happen?[l][p]
c0_020_0894,...Oh, right. Lots of things have been happening[r]around here.[l][p]
c0_020_0895,Like people dying.[l][p]
c0_020_0896,Boss, let's talk to this guy.[l][p]
c0_020_0897,Though you're a curse bearer, so please be careful.[l][p]
c0_020_0898,Fortunately, I don't think he knows which one of us[r]is the curse bearer yet.[l][p]
c0_020_0899,If we play things right, we should be okay.[l][p]
c0_020_0900,I see! He's warning him now that there's no[r]point in lying![l][p]
c0_020_0901,I had no idea a simple lie would set off the[r]curse stone, though![l][p]
c0_020_0902,If this were a normal case, I'd be fine letting[r]him take the reins.[l][p]
c0_020_0903,But curses are involved here. I should take over.[l][p]
c0_020_0904,So, what is it you were doing here?[l][p]
c0_020_0905,Ah... It must be the incident at the Former[r]Yasuda Gardens. The dead policeman?[l][p]
c0_020_0906,I can't imagine a detective would come all the[r]way out here otherwise.[l][p]
c0_020_0907,Huh...?[l][p]
c0_020_0908,Say, Mr. Detective.[l][p]
c0_020_0909,Have you ever heard of [c3]the Evergreen Beech[c0]?[l][p]
c0_020_0910,How about you answer my question first?[r]What were you doing here?[l][p]
c0_020_0911,I was answering your question.[l][p]
c0_020_0912,I came here to look for the Evergreen Beech[r]from the Seven Mysteries of Honjo.[l][p]
c0_020_0913,One of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo, right?[r]Why do you ask?[l][p]
c0_020_0914,I was just looking for it.[l][p]
c0_020_0915,Actually, I was wondering if either of you knew[r]anything about it.[l][p]
c0_020_0916,Nope, sorry.[l][p]
c0_020_0917,Really...?[l][p]
c0_020_0918,How strange...[l][p]
c0_020_0919,If it's the Evergreen Beech you're after, you'd[r]be better off looking around the Former Yasuda[r]Gardens than here.[l][p]
c0_020_0920,Oh, you know a lot about this.[l][p]
c0_020_0921,But that's what I thought.[l][p]
c0_020_0922,Detectives. You have the curse stone of the[r]Evergreen Beech, don't you?
c0_020_0923,You—!? How did you know!?[l][p]
c0_020_0924,Erio... You idiot![l][p]
c0_020_0925,Ahaha! Well, that was much easier than expected.[l][p]
c0_020_0926,Oh, crap... Sorry![l][p]
c0_020_0927,It was simple inference. I figured you would've[r]taken the curse if you were just in the Gardens.[l][p]
c0_020_0928,If you know that, then...[l][p]
c0_020_0929,You must be a curse bearer yourself.[l][p]
c0_020_0930,I have no intentions of hiding anything.[r]I planned to tell you from the start.[l][p]
c0_020_0931,Look.[l][p]
c0_020_0932,This is my curse stone. I believe it's called[r][c3]the Foot-Washing Mansion[c0]?[l][p]
c0_020_0933,That's right. But are you sure about this?[l][p]
c0_020_0934,I'm not so rash that I'd kill someone as soon as[r]I found out they were a curse bearer.[r]Not without talking to them first.[l][p]
c0_020_0935,You're the same, aren't you, Detectives?[r]You wouldn't use a curse on a normal person.[l][p]
c0_020_0936,Let's speak as equals, shall we?[l][p]
c0_020_0937,Boss...?[l][p]
c0_020_0938,Sure. We'd rather resolve this amicably, too.[l][p]
c0_020_0939,But before we talk, there's something I should[r]tell you.[l][p]
c0_020_0940,Hm...?[l][p]
c0_020_0941,This is my curse stone.[r]The Evergreen Beech, just like you thought.[l][p]
c0_020_0942,What!?[l][p]
c0_020_0943,Wha... Boss, why would you tell him!?[l][p]
c0_020_0944,As for how the curse works...[l][p]
c0_020_0945,Boss! Are you having another senior moment?[r]If you tell him that—[l][p]
c0_020_0946,It hangs to death anyone who would try to[r]mislead me.[l][p]
c0_020_0947,...![l][p]
c0_020_0948,So if you try to lie to me...[l][p]
c0_020_0949,The curse stone will let me know.[l][p]
c0_020_0950,I don't have to use it to tell. Understand?[l][p]
c0_020_0951,Whoa, really? That's super useful...[l][p]
c0_020_0952,...I see. Understood.[l][p]
c0_020_0953,That's a pretty useful power for a detective.[l][p]
c0_020_0954,Now then... Let's talk.[l][p]
c0_020_0955,Damn... It seems I've lost the upper hand.[l][p]
c0_020_0956,No point for petty tricks, then.[r]I'll be honest with you.[l][p]
c0_020_0957,...So far so good.[l][p]
c0_020_0958,There's someone I want to bring back. So...[r]I'd like your assistance in collecting soul dregs.[l][p]
c0_020_0959,Can't help you.[l][p]
c0_020_0960,Please. All you'd have to do is tell me who the[r]other curse bearers are.[l][p]
c0_020_0961,Sorry, but as a police officer, I can't just[r]look the other way and let you go.[l][p]
c0_020_0962,Please. If you help me, I'll let you two go[r]as well.[l][p]
c0_020_0963,Is that a threat?[l][p]
c0_020_0964,No...[l][p]
c0_020_0965,It's your final warning.[l][p]
c0_020_0966,The man identifies himself as Yutaro Namigaki,[r]a twenty-one-year-old college student.[l][p]
c0_020_0967,He was watching us so calmly...[r]We need to be careful with this guy.[l][p]
c0_020_0968,<i>So... What to make of this guy.[l][p]
c0_020_0969,<i>He really is a curse bearer...[l][p]
c0_020_0970,<i>He may only be talking with us to try and[r]activate his curse.[l][p]
c0_020_0971,<i>I'll have to be wary of anything he asks me to do.[l][p]
c0_020_0972,<i>I could tackle him and pin him to the ground...[r]But that might have something to do with his curse.[l][p]
c0_020_0973,<i>Any slip of the tongue could get us killed.[r]I have to try and discern what activates his curse.[l][p]
c0_020_0974,<i>So... What do I do?[l][p]
c0_020_0975,Ngh![l][p]
c0_020_0976,My curse, the Foot-Washing Mansion...[l][p]
c0_020_0977,Did you really think you could escape it just[r]by being careful?[l][p]
c0_020_0978,It didn't matter to me which of you was the[r]curse bearer. I'll be taking both of your[r]soul dregs anyway.[l][p]
c0_020_0979,Wait! Namigaki![l][p]
c0_020_0980,The Foot-Washing Mansion is a powerful curse![r]And so simple to activate![l][p]
c0_020_0981,It is ready whenever I need it.[r]There is no escape from the voice of my feet![l][p]
c0_020_0982,Erio! Get out of here! Hurry![r]I'll find you later![l][p]
c0_020_0983,What?! O-okay![l][p]
c0_020_0984,Too late! Hear the voice of my curse echo![l][p]
c0_020_0985,Ngh! The voice of his curse echo...!?[l][p]
c0_020_0986,Gah! This voice! This is—aaagh![l][p]

c0_020_0988,My, my, [%0]... You seem to have arrived at a[r]less-than-favorable result.[l][p]
c0_020_0989,This is mere conjecture on my part, but...[l][p]
c0_020_0990,I believe you may be aware of [c3]a way to escape[c0][r]Yutaro's curse.[l][p]
c0_020_0991,Fear not. You may make as many attempts as you[r]please from the point Yutaro uses his curse.[l][p]
c0_020_0992,Very well.[l][p]
c0_020_0993,Very well.[r]This chapter will remain "incomplete" for now.[l][p]

c0_020_0995,Wh-what!? Why isn't my curse echo working!?[l][p]
c0_020_0996,Impossible... This has never happened![l][p]
c0_020_0997,What's happening...? I don't hear anything.[l][p]
c0_020_0998,Erio, now! Grab him![l][p]
c0_020_0999,R-right![l][p]
c0_020_1000,Namigaki! Get down![l][p]
c0_020_1001,Gaaah! Damn it![l][p]
c0_020_1002,Boss, here! His curse stone![l][p]
c0_020_1003,Good work. Give it to me![l][p]
c0_020_1004,[N:src=ju_asi w=300 h=300 x=0 y=40 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Curse stone[c0] acquired: [c3]The Foot-Washing Mansion[c0]
c0_020_1005,Damn it! Why...?[l][p]
c0_020_1006,What do you think, Boss? Should we lock him up?[l][p]
c0_020_1007,I haven't even touched you! You can't consider[r]that assault of a police officer![l][p]
c0_020_1008,Let him go. All we need is the stone.[l][p]
c0_020_1009,Ugh... How could this happen...[r]My Rite of Resurrection...![l][p]
c0_020_1010,Give it up. The Rite was too good to be true[r]from the start.[l][p]
c0_020_1011,I don't know what happened to you, but you'd be[r]better off mourning whoever you lost the right way.[l][p]
c0_020_1012,Now get out of here.[l][p]
c0_020_1013,Damn it...![l][p]
c0_020_1014,Phew. That was a close one, huh, Boss?[l][p]
c0_020_1015,We'd probably be dead if he had activated[r]his curse.[l][p]
c0_020_1016,Yeah. I'm not sure what, but something stopped[r]his curse from... Ngh![l][p]
c0_020_1017,Boss? Are you okay?[r]Does having another curse stone hurt?[l][p]
c0_020_1018,Yeah... The curse from this one is flowing into me too...[l][p]
c0_020_1019,Oh no...[l][p]
c0_020_1020,I saw what activates the curse of the Foot-Washing[r]Mansion...and the resentful memories bound to it.[l][p]
c0_020_1021,Ah... I see. I always thought this one was one[r]of the stranger of the Seven Mysteries...[l][p]
c0_020_1022,Now I know why. This sure is something.[l][p]
c0_020_1023,Wh-what did you see?[l][p]
c0_020_1024,Let's save that for later. All you need to know[r]for now is that it's a particularly powerful[r]curse. We're lucky we took it from him quickly.[l][p]
c0_020_1025,Phew...[l][p]
c0_020_1026,Well, that makes one stone. Where do we go now?[l][p]
c0_020_1027,We'll visit all the places associated with the[r]mysteries while it's still dark out.[l][p]
c0_020_1028,You mean we have to do that all over again?[l][p]
c0_020_1029,I hope they aren't all as aggressive as him, but...[l][p]
c0_020_1030,People will do crazy things to bring back[r]someone they love...[l][p]
c0_020_1031,It seems that the hatred the curse stones are[r]imbued with makes people more willing to kill.[l][p]
c0_020_1032,Really...? Then what about you, Boss?[l][p]
c0_020_1033,I'm fine. I may not have any spirit sense, but[r]I'm tough when it comes to this stuff.[l][p]
c0_020_1034,That's why they loved me in Paranormal Affairs.[l][p]
c0_020_1035,So you are spiritually gifted after all![l][p]

c0_030_0456,W-well, let's get it over with. I'm a busy man.[l][p]
c0_030_0457,Boss, let's ask Hideki some questions.[l][p]
c0_030_0458,Questioning people like this can put unnecessary[r]stress on them depending on their position.[l][p]
c0_030_0459,This guy is pretty sharp. I'll have to play it[r]safe, and only push him when I see an opening.[l][p]
c0_030_0460,About the Record of Fates
c0_030_0461,Now, Mr. Araishi. What were you doing here at[r]this time of night?[l][p]
c0_030_0462,D-doing research, of course. Day or night,[r]information never sleeps.[l][p]
c0_030_0463,That's an admirable philosophy. You know, your[r]research has been quite the talk around town.[l][p]
c0_030_0464,What was it they were saying? You discovered[r]something about some book...?
c0_030_0465,Ah, right—you found some kind of ritual in the[r]Record of Fates.[l][p]
c0_030_0466,Hmph. It's obvious you don't know a thing.[l][p]
c0_030_0467,It's the Record of Fates. How rude.[l][p]
c0_030_0468,Yeah, that's it. Sorry about that.[r]I should've done my research.[l][p]
c0_030_0469,But it's true that you found some kind of ritual[r]in that book, right?[l][p]
c0_030_0470,What, don't tell me you want to know how to[r]carry out the Rite of Resurrection too?[l][p]
c0_030_0471,To be perfectly honest, I'm tired of people asking[r]me about it all the time.[l][p]
c0_030_0472,None of you even care about the local history. You[r]just come crawling out of the woodwork when[r]something interesting comes up.[l][p]
c0_030_0473,Looks like I hit a nerve.[l][p]
c0_030_0474,If you think you can force me to tell you because[r]you're policemen, you're sorely mistaken.[l][p]
c0_030_0475,Was the research you were doing just now also[r]related to the Rite of Resurrection?[l][p]
c0_030_0476,Well, yes. That's right.[l][p]
c0_030_0477,What exactly were you looking for?[l][p]
c0_030_0478,I-I have no reason to tell you that.[r]You wouldn't understand anyway.[l][p]
c0_030_0479,Well, in that case...[l][p]
c0_030_0480,I think I might have a guess as to what it is you[r]were looking for.
c0_030_0481,Huh... I'm surprised you know that.[l][p]
c0_030_0482,There is indeed a theory that the Seven Mysteries[r]of Honjo began because of the Rite of[r]Resurrection.[l][p]
c0_030_0483,Well... My theory.[l][p]
c0_030_0484,Unraveling the Seven Mysteries may reveal the[r]secret of the Rite.[l][p]
c0_030_0485,I think quite a few people are looking into the[r]Mysteries for that reason.[l][p]
c0_030_0486,Midoricho Park is connected to the story of the[r]Taiko of Tsugaru, right?[l][p]
c0_030_0487,That's right. But that isn't the issue at hand.[l][p]
c0_030_0488,What...!?[l][p]
c0_030_0489,Damn it! If you know about that, then...![l][p]
c0_030_0490,Calm down. No need to get so defensive.[l][p]
c0_030_0491,We both want information, right?[r]Why don't we have a nice, friendly chat?[l][p]
c0_030_0492,A...a curse stone! You are a curse bearer![l][p]
c0_030_0493,A leaf... It is the Evergreen Beech, then?[l][p]
c0_030_0494,Yep. Will you show me yours?[l][p]
c0_030_0495,...[l][p]
c0_030_0496,This is mine. The Everburning Lantern.[l][p]
c0_030_0497,Hm. Interesting.[l][p]
c0_030_0498,I'll tell you this for free.[l][p]
c0_030_0499,The Evergreen Beech comes from a man who was[r]hanged for spreading false rumors.[l][p]
c0_030_0500,But the accusations against him were unfounded,[r]and he died cursing those who deceived him.[l][p]
c0_030_0501,Ah... So that is the [c4]resentful memory[c0] held within[r]the Evergreen Beech.[l][p]
c0_030_0502,The memories of the Seven Mysteries are truly[r]fascinating. If only I could collect them all...[l][p]
c0_030_0503,Do whatever you want, but you should know[r]something.[l][p]
c0_030_0504,This stone of mine lets me curse anyone who tries[r]to mislead me.[l][p]
c0_030_0505,Wh-what!? But...![l][p]
c0_030_0506,So don't try and lie to me. I'll know.[l][p]
c0_030_0507,You...you would curse a citizen!?[r]And you call yourself an officer of the law![l][p]
c0_030_0508,That all depends on you. I don't want to use it if[r]I don't have to.[l][p]
c0_030_0509,Wh-what is it you want?[l][p]
c0_030_0510,The curse stones are dangerous.[r]I'd like to confiscate yours.[l][p]
c0_030_0511,Excuse me!? B-but my Rite...[l][p]
c0_030_0512,First let me ask you one thing.[l][p]
c0_030_0513,You...[l][p]
c0_030_0514,You haven't used that curse, have you?[l][p]
c0_030_0515,N-no! Of course I haven't! I swear![l][p]
c0_030_0516,...[l][p]
c0_030_0517,...I see. Good.[l][p]
c0_030_0518,Now, why don't you hand over that stone?[l][p]
c0_030_0519,Unless... You'd rather try using it on me instead.[l][p]
c0_030_0520,...[l][p]
c0_030_0521,Damn you! I won't give it to you![l][p]
c0_030_0522,...If I were to say that...what would happen?[r]Would it be a crime?[l][p]
c0_030_0523,The police are aware of how dangerous the stones[r]are. I could arrest you under Article 1, Section 2[r]of the Minor Offenses Act.[l][p]
c0_030_0524,Or you hand it over and all you lose is your[r]secret ability. Think of what would happen to all[r]your research if you were arrested?[l][p]
c0_030_0525,...[l][p]
c0_030_0526,Fine.[l][p]
c0_030_0527,You can have the stone. Here.[l][p]
c0_030_0528,[N:src=ju_kez w=300 h=300 x=0 y=40 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Curse stone[c0] acquired: [c3]The Everburning Lantern[c0]
c0_030_0529,Good choice. I look forward to seeing how your[r]research pans out.[l][p]
c0_030_0530,Hmph...[l][p]
c0_030_0531,Oh, right. Would you tell us everything you know[r]about what's been going on?[l][p]
c0_030_0532,If you help us out, we'll give you all the[r]information we've gotten after we solve the case.[r]What do you say?[l][p]
c0_030_0533,...[l][p]
c0_030_0534,In that case... Will you tell me about all the[r]resentful memories of the Seven Mysteries?[l][p]
c0_030_0535,I believe they are the key to the secret hidden in[r]the Record of Fates.[l][p]
c0_030_0536,Sure, why not. I'll learn about them as I[r]collect the curse stones.[l][p]
c0_030_0537,<cspace=-3px><color=#ddd><font="TELOP">Incomplete
c0_030_0538,I won't mince words.[r]I'd like to confiscate your curse stone.[l][p]
c0_030_0539,Excuse me? You may be a policeman, but you have[r]no right to do that.[l][p]
c0_030_0540,The police are aware of how dangerous the stones[r]are. I could arrest you under Article 1, Section 2[r]of the Minor Offenses Act.[l][p]
c0_030_0541,Or you hand it over and all you lose is your[r]secret ability. Think of what would happen to all[r]your research if you were arrested?[l][p]
c0_030_0542,...[l][p]
c0_030_0543,Hmph. I call your bluff.[r]The stones could never be used as evidence.[l][p]
c0_030_0544,If you want it...you'll have to take it by force.[l][p]
c0_030_0545,I find it hard to imagine that an officer of the[r]law would use a curse on a citizen.[l][p]
c0_030_0546,You can't touch me. ...Which means I have no[r]reason to continue this conversation.[l][p]
c0_030_0547,We both want information, right?[r]Why don't we have a nice, friendly chat?[l][p]
c0_030_0548,Hmph. You may say that, but I don't trust you.[l][p]
c0_030_0549,Perhaps you've already learned about curses.[l][p]
c0_030_0550,Perhaps you want to take my power away from me.[l][p]
c0_030_0551,No, that's not true.[l][p]
c0_030_0552,I almost revealed my hand...[r]I'll say nothing else.[l][p]
c0_030_0553,Are you doing all this research so you can use[r]the Rite of Resurrection yourself?[l][p]
c0_030_0554,Hmph. You're a policeman; do you really think[r]people can be brought back to life?[l][p]
c0_030_0555,Everyone I meet... Pitiful.[l][p]
c0_030_0556,Huh...? So you don't believe in the Rite?[l][p]
c0_030_0557,Whether it's real or not has nothing to do with[r]my research.[l][p]
c0_030_0558,Such things are better left to the occult freaks.[l][p]
c0_030_0559,Or...so I thought...[l][p]
c0_030_0560,...Hm?[l][p]
c0_030_0561,Things changed. It has become necessary for me to[r]pursue the Rite.[l][p]
c0_030_0562,So now... Now I pray that it is real.[l][p]
c0_030_0563,What changed?[l][p]
c0_030_0564,I'm sure you can imagine.[r]The funds for my research.[l][p]
c0_030_0565,I receive a large amount of funding for seeking[r]the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
c0_030_0566,And if I find it...I'll receive a sum so great[r]that I'll never have to worry about money again.[l][p]
c0_030_0567,Oho. Then that means...[l][p]
c0_030_0568,Someone is sponsoring your research. Is that right?
c0_030_0569,So what if they are?[l][p]
c0_030_0570,You have no idea how hard we work to secure[r]funding for our research.[l][p]
c0_030_0571,I have no interest in teaching those children.[l][p]
c0_030_0572,...Listen to me. I'll tell you one thing.[l][p]
c0_030_0573,Those experts you see writing provocative books or[r]spouting nonsense on TV to try and get popular?[l][p]
c0_030_0574,All of them are just trying to get the money they[r]need to do their research.[l][p]
c0_030_0575,With how popular the occult is, saying something[r]even remotely spooky can lead to big money.[l][p]
c0_030_0576,What!? But I bought your book![l][p]
c0_030_0577,"The pursuit of the unknown begins, first and[r]foremost, with belief."[r]I was so inspired by that bit![l][p]
c0_030_0578,I do appreciate your patronage. Unfortunately,[r]however, the occult is not my true interest.[l][p]
c0_030_0579,The fate of the unknown is to be destroyed by[r]thorough research and deep consideration.[l][p]
c0_030_0580,No way... I can't believe it...[l][p]
c0_030_0581,You're...surprisingly innocent.[l][p]
c0_030_0582,Then what kind of research do you want to be doing?[l][p]
c0_030_0583,Hmph. I'm sure it wouldn't interest you, but to[r]put it simply...[l][p]
c0_030_0584,The focus of my research is how historical accounts[r]transform into folklore over the years as they are[r]passed down from generation to generation.[l][p]
c0_030_0585,What does that mean?[l][p]
c0_030_0586,Due to human bias, the account of any event is[r]inevitably changed by the person communicating it.[l][p]
c0_030_0587,This is not necessarily done with ill intentions.[l][p]
c0_030_0588,It happens when someone tries to fill in the gaps[r]in a story that lacks detail.[l][p]
c0_030_0589,Or when something's left out or abridged because[r]of the story's length.[l][p]
c0_030_0590,Or when a story twists and shifts as it's spread[r]through oral tradition.[l][p]
c0_030_0591,Even when two stories are told about the same event,[r]differences in culture or environment affect how[r]it's told, changing its content.[l][p]
c0_030_0592,Silly little things can turn into terribly[r]mysterious legends.[l][p]
c0_030_0593,My research is the study of how history, culture,[r]and legend all influence each other.[l][p]
c0_030_0594,Huh... I see.[l][p]
c0_030_0595,Take the Seven Mysteries of Honjo, for example.[l][p]
c0_030_0596,Why are some of the Mysteries seemingly about[r]nothing particularly interesting?[l][p]
c0_030_0597,You'd think stories wouldn't last a decade, let[r]alone hundreds of years. So why?[l][p]
c0_030_0598,Perhaps putting it that way piques your interest?[l][p]
c0_030_0599,I admit, I am curious.[l][p]
c0_030_0600,So that's what you've been researching all this[r]time. Makes sense.[l][p]
c0_030_0601,As I said, it doesn't matter to me whether the[r]Rite exists or not.[l][p]
c0_030_0602,If people in the Edo period believed that what was[r]written in the Record of Fates was real...[l][p]
c0_030_0603,That's all I'm interested in.[l][p]
c0_030_0604,But I have to be realistic. The research I'd like[r]to do is unfortunately not very lucrative.[l][p]
c0_030_0605,That's why I need to take some risks.[l][p]
c0_030_0606,This "Record of Fates"... Where did you get your[r]hands on it?[l][p]
c0_030_0607,The storehouse of an old private residence in the[r]city, just as the public was told.[l][p]
c0_030_0608,I'm unable to be more precise due to an agreement[r]with my informant.[l][p]
c0_030_0609,From appearances, it's hard to imagine this small,[r]bookish, well-spoken man being very dangerous.[l][p]
c0_030_0610,But in this day and age, you never know.[r]I should be careful.[l][p]
c0_030_0611,<i>Hideki Araishi. He says he's a local historian...[l][p]
c0_030_0612,<i>But supposedly he knows more about the Rite of[r]Resurrection than anybody.[l][p]
c0_030_0613,<i>The fact he's here at this time of night...[r]It's plenty possible that he's a curse bearer.[l][p]
c0_030_0614,Sorry. I'll be taking my leave here.
c0_030_0615,Hey, stop![l][p]
c0_030_0616,Ngh... He's so fast...[l][p]
c0_030_0617,Sorry, Boss... He got away.[l][p]
c0_030_0618,But thanks to you, we learned a lot from him.[l][p]
c0_030_0619,I wonder... The Mysteries and Rite are all[r]public information.[l][p]
c0_030_0620,He kept everything he knows about the other curse[r]bearers and the source of the curse here hidden.[l][p]
c0_030_0621,I was hoping he'd at least give us a clue about[r]how to beat these curses...[l][p]
c0_030_0622,Oh, I see... Then we should be more aggressive[r]next time, really make them spit it out![r]...And by we, I mean you.[l][p]
c0_030_0623,I'm guessing he wants to save this curse.[r]He wouldn't have told us anything, no matter what[r]we asked.[l][p]
c0_030_0624,But now we know where he hangs out.[r]We can always send someone for him if need be.[l][p]
c0_030_0625,Right. Got it.[l][p]
c0_030_0626,I was surprised to hear that there are actually[r][c3]nine[c0] of the Seven Mysteries, though.[l][p]
c0_030_0627,Yeah. That's two extra curse bearers we have[r]to find.[l][p]
c0_030_0628,We've confiscated two, so there are six more.[r]They could be anywhere in this town.[l][p]
c0_030_0629,We have to find them fast or they may start using[r]the curses.[l][p]
c0_030_0630,No... I think we're already too late.[l][p]
c0_030_0631,Huh...?[l][p]
c0_030_0632,I didn't tell you this, but... There were some[r]soul dregs in Namigaki's curse stone.[l][p]
c0_030_0633,Really!? Then he already killed someone with it!?[l][p]
c0_030_0634,It's not much, so it probably wasn't a curse[r]bearer... Shit.[l][p]
c0_030_0635,Well, we know who did it. We can make arrangements[r]to take him into custody.[l][p]
c0_030_0636,We'll have Paranormal Affairs pick him up tomorrow.[r]For now, we continue our search.[l][p]
c0_030_0637,Right. On to the next place. We just have to cross[r]them off the list one by one.[l][p]
c0_030_0638,Oh, but... Boss?[l][p]
c0_030_0639,Hm?[l][p]
c0_030_0640,Good to know we can use the Minor Offenses Act to[r]arrest people with curse stones![l][p]
c0_030_0641,But why didn't we do that with Namigaki...?[l][p]
c0_030_0642,If we could do that, there'd be no need for[r]Paranormal Affairs.[l][p]
c0_030_0643,What grounds would a normal detective have to put[r]him under arrest?[l][p]
c0_030_0644,Oh... Right. Yeah, I suppose that's true...[l][p]

c0_040_0230,Well...[l][p]
c0_040_0231,With this, we'll have visited every place[r]connected to the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
c0_040_0232,This is the last spot, huh?[r]And we've got nothing to show for it.[l][p]
c0_040_0233,Even though every last location looked suspect[r]from top to bottom.[l][p]
c0_040_0234,Maybe we came at the wrong time. There might not[r]have been any curse bearers around.[l][p]

c0_040_0243,Is...is he dead!?[l][p]
c0_040_0244,Damn it... We were too late![r]Was this a curse too?[l][p]
c0_040_0245,H-hang on, I'm going to call this in![l][p]
c0_040_0246,I'll leave it to you![r]I'm gonna take a look around![l][p]
c0_040_0247,Boss! Bad news![l][p]
c0_040_0248,What is it?[l][p]
c0_040_0249,Another mysterious death was reported in the area[r]just now.[l][p]
c0_040_0250,The medical unit and forensics team are on their[r]way, but it'll be a while before they arrive.
c0_040_0251,Ah. That is bad news.[r]So they got someone else...[l][p]
c0_040_0252,You think this is the work of a curse bearer?[l][p]
c0_040_0253,With suspicious deaths popping up one after[r]another, we have to assume it is.[l][p]
c0_040_0254,...Shit. Guess we'll be stuck waiting around for[r]a while.[l][p]
c0_040_0255,...Huh?[l][p]
c0_040_0256,Boss. That phone is ringing...[l][p]
c0_040_0257,I checked the surroundings earlier. There were no[r]signs of a curse bearer or any curse echoes around.[l][p]
c0_040_0258,The ringing of the phone is the only sound[r]cutting through the quiet park.[l][p]
c0_040_0259,...Well. We better go check it out.[l][p]
c0_040_0260,You're right. But be careful! It could be a curse.[l][p]
c0_040_0261,Hey, I said we. You expect me to go alone?[l][p]
c0_040_0262,You're the one who's tough against this stuff.[r]Don't worry Boss, you can do it! Go on now![l][p]
c0_040_0263,Damn it.[l][p]
c0_040_0264,He seems distracted by the phone.[l][p]
c0_040_0265,A young man in his twenties killed in cold blood...[l][p]
c0_040_0266,He's definitely dead...but I can't quite discern[r]the cause from what I've seen.[l][p]
c0_040_0267,There are no obvious external wounds, but...[r]what is that leaking from his mouth? Water?[l][p]
c0_040_0268,...Boss. The phone.[l][p]
c0_040_0269,What about it?[l][p]
c0_040_0270,It's ringing.[l][p]
c0_040_0271,It sure is.[l][p]
c0_040_0272,...Aren't you going to pick it up?[l][p]
c0_040_0273,Huh? Why would I?[l][p]
c0_040_0274,Why wouldn't you? It's super suspicious.[l][p]
c0_040_0275,Oh, give it a rest.[l][p]
c0_040_0276,Do you have anything better to do?[l][p]
c0_040_0277,Well, not exactly...[l][p]
c0_040_0278,Then why don't you pick it up?[l][p]
c0_040_0279,We'll miss it if you don't hurry.[l][p]
c0_040_0280,Right, they'll probably hang up soon...[l][p]
c0_040_0281,Are you really okay with that?[r]You aren't the least bit curious?[l][p]
c0_040_0282,I guess I'm a little curious...[l][p]
c0_040_0283,Ah... So you're one of those people.[l][p]
c0_040_0284,You think that if you pick up the phone too quickly[r]the caller will think you have nothing going on.[l][p]
c0_040_0285,So you deliberately let it ring a bunch of times[r]before answering.[l][p]
c0_040_0286,Do people really do that?[l][p]
c0_040_0287,There are definitely some who want to give off the[r]impression of being busier than they really are.[l][p]
c0_040_0288,Well, detectives don't have time for that kind of[r]foolishness.[l][p]
c0_040_0289,Then go pick it up.[l][p]
c0_040_0290,...Fine.[l][p]
c0_040_0291,You leave me no choice... I'll answer it![l][p]
c0_040_0292,H-hold on, Erio![l][p]
c0_040_0293,We don't know what could happen.[r]...I'll do it.[l][p]
c0_040_0294,Sure. It's all yours.[l][p]
c0_040_0295,You little...![l][p]
c0_040_0296,...You know, it might just keep ringing till you[r]pick up.[l][p]
c0_040_0297,True. It might even be ringing because someone[r]knows we're here.[l][p]
c0_040_0298,It's entirely possible. In which case...[l][p]
c0_040_0299,Come on... Any time now.[l][p]
c0_040_0300,<i>The phone booth seems to be ringing.[l][p]
c0_040_0301,<i>I didn't even know these could receive calls.[l][p]
c0_040_0302,Uh, hello? Kinshibori Park phone booth...[l][p]
c0_040_0303,<i>Took you long enough, Tsutsumi! Did no one teach[r]you to pick up the fuckin' phone when it rings!?

c0_040_0312,<i>What a time that was... As I recall, I gave you[r]quite the runaround.[l][p]
c0_040_0313,Wait... Is this...[l][p]
c0_040_0314,[c3]Fumichika Nejima[c0]?
c0_040_0315,What? Did you say Fumichika Nejima...?[l][p]
c0_040_0316,Like the one from the Nejima Murders!?[l][p]
c0_040_0317,<i>...[l][p]
c0_040_0318,<i>Ding ding ding! You got it! I had a feeling that[r]the great Chief Tsutsumi would remember me.[l][p]
c0_040_0319,<i>I spent twenty long years in a cell thanks to you.[r]That shit was not easy.[l][p]
c0_040_0320,You should be thanking me. Should've given you[r]plenty of time to think and atone for your sins.[l][p]
c0_040_0321,<i>Wahaha! That it did![r]I've repented! My conscience is clean as a whistle![l][p]
c0_040_0322,Bullshit. Twenty years in prison doesn't even[r]begin to make up for the shit you did.[l][p]
c0_040_0323,<i>I dunno about that. After all, the justice system[r]was gracious enough to grant me parole.[l][p]
c0_040_0324,...What?[l][p]
c0_040_0325,<i>If this is the real Fumichika Nejima, he must[r]still have a grudge against me for arresting him.[l][p]
c0_040_0326,<i>So is this payback? Damn it![l][p]
c0_040_0327,What is your goal?[l][p]
c0_040_0328,<i>Now, now, you gotta understand...[l][p]
c0_040_0329,<i>I've repented! Seen the light! I've been a good[r]boy since I was granted parole.[l][p]
c0_040_0330,<i>I even got myself a job. I've been real serious[r]about walking the right path.[l][p]
c0_040_0331,Well, that's very nice. Keep it up.[l][p]
c0_040_0332,<i>But...it was no good.[l][p]
c0_040_0333,<i>When the opportunity arose...it was impossible[r]to hold myself back.[l][p]
c0_040_0334,<i>I knew I had to give you a little token of thanks[r]or I'd never truly be able to have a fresh start.[l][p]
c0_040_0335,<i>Do you get what I'm sayin'?[l][p]
c0_040_0336,No thanks, I don't need anything. No need to do[r]all that for me. Just try to live a quiet life.[l][p]
c0_040_0337,<i>Oh, it's no hassle. No hassle at all.[l][p]
c0_040_0338,<i>...It would be all too easy to just kill you.[r]To tear you apart.[l][p]
c0_040_0339,<i>But...that wouldn't be very satisfying. Certainly[r]not after twenty fucking years of waiting.[l][p]
c0_040_0340,That's a long time to nurture a grudge.[l][p]
c0_040_0341,<i>You fucking bet it is. I let it gnaw at me. Grow[r]inside of me. I thought of nothing else.[l][p]
c0_040_0342,<i>All that time, I played model prisoner. Endured[r]the harassment those asshole guards threw at me.[l][p]
c0_040_0343,<i>And I did it all for you, Tsutsumi.[r]So please, just accept my deepest and most[r]sincere feelings.[l][p]
c0_040_0344,Sorry, but I'm afraid I don't feel the same way[r]about you.[l][p]
c0_040_0345,<i>Shut the fuck up! That attitude of yours is why[r]I'm saving you for last![l][p]
c0_040_0346,...What are you planning?[r]Whatever it is, bring it on. I'm not running away.[l][p]
c0_040_0347,<i>I just told you I'm not comin' for you yet![r]Pay attention when people talk, shithead![l][p]
c0_040_0348,<i>You see... This time...[l][p]
c0_040_0349,<i>This time, I want to see you on your knees,[r]weeping in despair, begging me for mercy.[l][p]
c0_040_0350,...[l][p]
c0_040_0351,Waaah! Oh no! I'm so sorry, dear Nejima![r]Please forgive me! I won't do it again![l][p]
c0_040_0352,<i>Shut the fuck up! This is exactly why I've always[r]hated you so fuckin' much![l][p]
c0_040_0353,It was worth a shot.[l][p]
c0_040_0354,<i>Did you really think that would sate me, asshole?[r]You must be crazy.[l][p]
c0_040_0355,Well then we're both crazy. We've got so much in[r]common, we should be friends.[l][p]
c0_040_0356,<i>Enjoy cracking your jokes while you still can.[l][p]
c0_040_0357,<i>I'm going to kill everyone you care about.[r]One by one, till there's no one left.[l][p]
c0_040_0358,Sorry to disappoint, but I'm a lone wolf.[r]I don't have anyone like that in my life.[l][p]
c0_040_0359,Uh... Boss? What about me?[l][p]
c0_040_0360,Or wait... Are you just trying to protect me...?[l][p]
c0_040_0361,<i>There's not a single person you care about?[l][p]
c0_040_0362,<i>I wonder what your sweet [c3]daughter[c0] would think[r]if she were to hear that.
c0_040_0363,...![l][p]
c0_040_0364,Don't you fucking dare! I'm warning you![l][p]
c0_040_0365,<i>Ooh, very nice! This is more like it![l][p]
c0_040_0366,<i>She's living all on her own now, isn't she?[r]Attending university and all. Such a good girl.[l][p]
c0_040_0367,<i>Oh my... Don't tell me that she just happens to[r]live in Honjo?
c0_040_0368,Wha...? She does!?[l][p]
c0_040_0369,No, forget it! This isn't funny, asshole![r]I'm going to find you and make you pay![l][p]
c0_040_0370,<i>Aah! I love it! Keep going! I want to hear you[r]lose your mind! It's music to my ears![l][p]
c0_040_0371,Haah...haah...! Fuck you![l][p]
c0_040_0372,<i>I look forward to chopping up your precious[r]daughter. It'll be just like old times.[l][p]
c0_040_0373,I won't let that happen.[l][p]
c0_040_0374,<i>Ah. One more thing we should discuss.[l][p]
c0_040_0375,<i>In fact...it's the most important thing.[l][p]
c0_040_0376,I thought you were finally going to shut up.[r]I'm already sick of you, so I'll pass.[l][p]
c0_040_0377,<i>Oh, but you don't want to miss this.[r]It's the main course.[l][p]
c0_040_0378,<i>I could just go after your daughter, but...[r]something tells me you'd get bored.[l][p]
c0_040_0379,No, I'm good. You got me real fired up. You're in[r]my head. Well done.[l][p]
c0_040_0380,<i>But this is a gift tailor-made for you...[l][p]
c0_040_0381,<i>I'm going to kill all the people you swore to[r]protect. Every last person living here.[l][p]
c0_040_0382,You couldn't![l][p]
c0_040_0383,<i>Oh, but with this curse of mine, I can![l][p]
c0_040_0384,<i>I'll give you until dusk.[l][p]
c0_040_0385,<i>By then...I could probably get a couple hundred[r]people or so.[l][p]
c0_040_0386,<i>And it'll aaall be your fault.[l][p]
c0_040_0387,<i>Oh, it must be so hard to know they'll all die[r]because of you. So tragic. It must be tearing[r]you apart! Wahaha![l][p]
c0_040_0388,Don't fuck with me! There's no way an amateur like[r]you could pull off a curse that strong![l][p]
c0_040_0389,<i>Unfortunately for you, I absolutely can. My curse[r]stone is a particularly strong one.[l][p]
c0_040_0390,<i>Which means I can have my fun without needing to[r]hold back one bit.[l][p]
c0_040_0391,<i>It's almost like the Feast of Shadows was cast[r]just for me.[l][p]
c0_040_0392,You're surprisingly well-informed about this.[r]Who was it that tipped you off?[l][p]
c0_040_0393,<i>Hmm, who knows?[l][p]
c0_040_0394,Then how about I kill myself first and ruin[r]all your fun? What about that, asshole?[l][p]
c0_040_0395,<i>Idiot! You think I'd call it off just because you[r]were dead!? There's no running away for you![l][p]
c0_040_0396,...Grh![l][p]
c0_040_0397,I'll find you. I won't let you get away with this,[r]Nejima![l][p]
c0_040_0398,<i>You've got twelve hours. Do you really think your[r]paltry little organization will be able to make[r]a dent in my plans?[l][p]
c0_040_0399,<i>Oh, the sacrifices made will be heavy... I can't[r]wait to see you sobbing with regret. Wahahaha![l][p]
c0_040_0400,<i>And I'll even have enough soul dregs to pull off[r]the Rite of Resurrection! How splendid![l][p]
c0_040_0401,Wait, Nejima![r]You're after the—[l][p]
c0_040_0402,<i>Anyway, see ya around! Bye-bye now![l][p]
c0_040_0403,How do you know where I am?[l][p]
c0_040_0404,<i>Wahahaha! That's my favorite part! The sound[r]of confusion in your voice; it's to die for![l][p]
c0_040_0405,<i>Mmm, this is delicious. I can't get enough.[l][p]
c0_040_0406,<i>I'm not telling you shit! Have fun racking your[r]tiny little brain for it! Wahahaha![l][p]
c0_040_0407,<i>Hmm...I guess I could give you a little hint.[l][p]
c0_040_0408,Go on.[l][p]
c0_040_0409,<i>Well, you see...[l][p]
c0_040_0410,<i>I have the [c3]One-sided Reed[c0].
c0_040_0411,...!?[l][p]
c0_040_0412,<i>Tsutsumi, you have the Evergreen Beech, no?[l][p]
c0_040_0413,Nejima...![l][p]
c0_040_0414,You're a curse bearer!?[l][p]
c0_040_0415,You're using the power of the curse![l][p]
c0_040_0416,<i>Indeed! And what a peculiar curse it is...[l][p]
c0_040_0417,<i>But that's where my hints end! Wahahaha![l][p]
c0_040_0418,Goddamn it! The curse echo couldn't have fallen[r]into worse hands...[l][p]
c0_040_0419,Boss![l][p]
c0_040_0420,Erio. Did you catch all that?[l][p]
c0_040_0421,Nejima... What is he planning!?[l][p]
c0_040_0422,Who knows. For now, we need to find him and get[r]him into custody. Send word to HQ.[l][p]
c0_040_0423,But the fact that the Seven Mysteries are wrapped[r]up in this is gonna make things tricky.[l][p]
c0_040_0424,You mean with Nejima being a curse bearer?[l][p]
c0_040_0425,Just our luck, really.[r]It couldn't have been a worse guy...[l][p]
c0_040_0426,Sounds like his curse will be able to kill a lotta[r]people at once. I'd like to avoid getting our[r]investigators caught in the crossfire.[l][p]
c0_040_0427,We'll use them to find out where he is, but then[r]we're going in alone.[l][p]
c0_040_0428,We should try to collect as many curse stones as[r]we can before then. Let's hurry.[l][p]
c0_040_0429,Aye, aye, Boss![l][p]
c0_040_0430,Later...[l][p]
c0_040_0431,It was reported that a total of three suspicious[r]deaths were discovered that night.[l][p]
c0_040_0432,Nejima's threats, along with the curses, were kept[r]secret from the general public.[l][p]
c0_040_0433,However, the [c3]Honjo Serial Killings[c0] still made[r]international headlines following the death of[r]police officer Hajime Yoshimi.[l][p]
c0_040_0434,At Tsutsumi's request, a large-scale investigation[r]was launched into Fumichika Nejima's whereabouts.[l][p]
c0_040_0435,Tsutsumi and Erio themselves spent the rest of the[r]night looking for curse bearers in the area,[r]but their search ended in vain.[l][p]
c0_040_0436,And with that, the curtain closed[r]on that cursed night...[l][p]

c0_040_0439,Hm? What's this? There's something stuck to the[r]side of the phone.[l][p]

d0_010_0346,Um... Sorry, give me a second...[l][p]

d0_010_0354,All right, let's start.[l][p]
d0_010_0355,This is the spirit board. This is how we'll be[r]communicating.[l][p]
d0_010_0356,First, we'll both put a finger on the 10-yen[r]coin that's on the board.
d0_010_0357,Like this...?[l][p]
d0_010_0358,Just like that. Relax your finger as much as you[r]can.[l][p]
d0_010_0359,Now for the chant. Repeat what I say, okay?[l][p]
d0_010_0360,"Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. Please visit us."[l][p]
d0_010_0361,Your turn.[l][p]
d0_010_0362,...[%7], [%8],[r][%9]..[l][p]
d0_010_0363,You're a little off...[l][p]
d0_010_0364,Huh...?[l][p]
d0_010_0365,Just relax. I'll say it again.[l][p]
d0_010_0366,Good.[l][p]
d0_010_0367,"Please tell us if you are there."[l][p]
d0_010_0368,Whoa... It really moved...[l][p]
d0_010_0369,Looks like we succeeded in the summoning. We can[r]ask questions now.[l][p]
d0_010_0370,Right. Questions...[l][p]
d0_010_0371,Start with a question you know the answer to and[r]see the response.[l][p]
d0_010_0372,Then, when you know your questions are[r]being answered truthfully, you ask what you really[r]want to know.[l][p]
d0_010_0373,Okay.[r]I'll start with something simple.[l][p]
d0_010_0374,What is my name?
d0_010_0375,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. Are you truly the[r]Specter of the Spirit Board...?[l][p]
d0_010_0376,Huh? It said no? Is it lying?[l][p]
d0_010_0377,Not quite...[l][p]
d0_010_0378,The Specter of the Spirit Board is just a temporary[r]name we call them when using the board.[l][p]
d0_010_0379,We're actually calling a spirit with a strong tie[r]to this place, or one of the people participating.[l][p]
d0_010_0380,In other words, a spirit that just happened to be[r]nearby just felt like answering.[l][p]
d0_010_0381,They don't really think of themselves as the[r]Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d0_010_0382,Oh... Really?[l][p]
d0_010_0383,Huh... Feels like some of the mystique has[r]disappeared.[l][p]
d0_010_0384,Do you mind if I still call you the Specter of the[r]Spirit Board?[l][p]
d0_010_0385,"Yes."[r]Okay.[l][p]
d0_010_0386,Um... Thanks.[l][p]
d0_010_0387,Always good to remember to say please and[r]thank you.[l][p]
d0_010_0388,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[r]Where are we?[l][p]
d0_010_0389,H...i...g...h...[r]s...c...h...o...o...l...[l][p]
d0_010_0390,High school! That's right![l][p]
d0_010_0391,The answers don't seem to be very precise...[l][p]
d0_010_0392,I think it should know the answer to this...[l][p]
d0_010_0393,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[r]What is my name?[l][p]
d0_010_0394,...Huh? What's the matter.[l][p]
d0_010_0395,How strange...[l][p]
d0_010_0396,Huh...? It told me "no"...?[l][p]
d0_010_0397,Ahh. I bet it means it doesn't know.[l][p]
d0_010_0398,It may be the Specter of the Spirit Board, but[r]it doesn't know everything.[l][p]
d0_010_0399,Really...? But it knew your name, Mio.[l][p]
d0_010_0400,Is this spirit really the real deal?[l][p]
d0_010_0401,It's fine...[l][p]
d0_010_0402,I feel like it's giving me attitude...[l][p]
d0_010_0403,I'll ask it again. What is my name...?[l][p]
d0_010_0404,It didn't even hesitate this time.[l][p]
d0_010_0405,Tch...[l][p]
d0_010_0406,Fine. What is the name of the girl across from me?[l][p]
d0_010_0407,Mio... That's right.[l][p]
d0_010_0408,Grr... That's not fair. It knows your name, Mio.[l][p]
d0_010_0409,Mio... Yeah, see?[l][p]
d0_010_0410,It even used that weird character you use[r]to spell your name.[l][p]
d0_010_0411,How flattering...[l][p]

d0_010_0414,I bet. Even the teachers get it wrong all the[r]time.[l][p]
d0_010_0415,I guess these paranormal beings just tend to take[r]a liking to you.[l][p]
d0_010_0416,Huh... I don't know how I should feel about[r]that...[l][p]
d0_010_0417,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. What is the name of the boy[r]Mio has a crush on?[l][p]
d0_010_0418,Hey...!? You're going to ask that kind of[r]question?[l][p]
d0_010_0419,Doesn't everyone ask this kind of stuff with[r]spirit boards? Besides, I'm curious.[l][p]
d0_010_0420,No, no, no. Let's not do this.[l][p]
d0_010_0421,Huh... It said "No..." Guess that must mean you don't have[r]a crush on anyone.[l][p]
d0_010_0422,Whew...[l][p]
d0_010_0423,Yeah, that's it. No is correct.[r]Let's move on.[l][p]
d0_010_0424,Ah, or maaaybe...[l][p]
d0_010_0425,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. Do you mean the boy[r]isn't in our class...?[l][p]
d0_010_0426,Wow![l][p]
d0_010_0427,H-hey, stop that! Don't make me exorcise you![l][p]
d0_010_0428,If that's the case, then...[l][p]
d0_010_0429,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. Is it a teacher at[r]our school...?[l][p]
d0_010_0430,Aww. No good, huh...[l][p]
d0_010_0431,Phew...[l][p]
d0_010_0432,Yakko, cut it out already...[l][p]
d0_010_0433,We made the effort to sneak in at night. We[r]shouldn't waste time with these questions.[l][p]
d0_010_0434,You've got a point.[l][p]
d0_010_0435,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. Who does Mio have[r]a cru—[l][p]
d0_010_0436,Yakko. I'll go home.[l][p]
d0_010_0437,Fiiine.[l][p]
d0_010_0438,Okay, here I go. I'll be serious now.[l][p]
d0_010_0439,Yes, please.[l][p]
d0_010_0440,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d0_010_0441,Did Michiyo... [r]Did [c4]Michiyo Shiraishi[c0] in our class...[l][p]
d0_010_0442,who died by committing suicide by jumping one[r]week ago...[l][p]
d0_010_0443,really commit suicide?[l][p]
d0_010_0444,...![l][p]
d0_010_0445,So it really wasn't...[l][p]
d0_010_0446,I'm not surprised. I never believed it from the[r]start.[l][p]
d0_010_0447,Now's the important part...[l][p]
d0_010_0448,Yeah.[l][p]
d0_010_0449,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d0_010_0450,Did Michiyo Shiraishi die in an accident...?[l][p]
d0_010_0451,It said, "Yes..."[l][p]
d0_010_0452,So it was an accident and not a suicide...[l][p]
d0_010_0453,Michiyo...[l][p]
d0_010_0454,Then... Did she slip and fall from that apartment[r]building...?[l][p]
d0_010_0455,Huh...? She didn't...?[l][p]
d0_010_0456,What do you mean...?[l][p]
d0_010_0457,Michiyo didn't die falling from the apartment[r]building?[l][p]
d0_010_0458,No way![l][p]
d0_010_0459,If that were true...[l][p]
d0_010_0460,Then why was she lying on the ground like that in[r]the back alley of the apartment building...?[l][p]
d0_010_0461,It was an accident, but not a fall?[l][p]
d0_010_0462,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. What happened to[r]Michiyo on that day?[l][p]
d0_010_0463,Seems like it doesn't know the details...[l][p]
d0_010_0464,...[l][p]
d0_010_0465,Then how about...[r]Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d0_010_0466,We want to use that Rite of Resurrection to bring[r]Michiyo back to life.[l][p]
d0_010_0467,Do you know where the Rite of Resurrection is...?[l][p]
d0_010_0468,I wonder...[l][p]
d0_010_0469,Huh...?[l][p]

d0_020_0732,[s0][a0.5]"Did you hear about Michiyo in Class C?"
d0_020_0733,[s0][a0.5]"Yeah. She seemed like the stereotypical honor[r]student in her first year, but..."
d0_020_0734,[s0][a0.5]"She stopped showing up to class and her[r]grades started dropping after her third semester."
d0_020_0735,[s0][a0.5]"So she offed herself 'cause her grades[r]were bad? No fair..."
d0_020_0736,[s0][a0.5]"Just thinking about practice tests makes me[r]wanna die, too. All anyone cares about is test[r]scores and grades."
d0_020_0737,[s0][a0.5]"Did you know? I heard Michiyo's mom remarried[r]last year..."
d0_020_0738,[s0][a0.5]"They say her new stepdad is a total jerk!"
d0_020_0739,[s0][a0.5]"Really? How so?"
d0_020_0740,[s0][a0.5]"Like, he'd peek on her while she changes[r]and couldn't keep his hands off her."
d0_020_0741,[s0][a0.5]"I even heard he's an ex-con! If she resists him,[r]he gets violent..."
d0_020_0742,[s0][a0.5]"That's so scary! No way! I couldn't take that!"
d0_020_0743,[s0][a0.5]"I'd probably think about killing myself[r]too if I had to deal with someone like that at[r]home."
d0_020_0744,[s0][a0.5]"You hear about suicides on the news, but for it to[r]happen here... It's a little scary."
d0_020_0745,[s0][a0.5]"By the way... Isn't there a girl who transferred[r]into Class C recently?"
d0_020_0746,[s0][a0.5]"Oh, I heard about her. She's gloomy,[r]doesn't stand out much."
d0_020_0747,[s0][a0.5]"Did you know that the school she was at before[r]she transferred also had a suicide?"
d0_020_0748,[s0][a0.5]"What...? For real? That seems, like, kinda[r]fishy."
d0_020_0749,[s0][a0.5]"Hey, did you hear?[r]Someone from our school committed suicide!"
d0_020_0750,[s0][a0.5]"What, really? Who?"
d0_020_0751,[s0][a0.5]"I heard that.[r]Michiyo from Class C, right?"
d0_020_0752,[s0][a0.5]"No way... Michiyo?"
d0_020_0753,[s0][a0.5]"She'd been acting pretty strangely lately...[r]But I still can't believe it..."
d0_020_0754,Ahem... There might be some of you who already[r]know, but...[l][p]
d0_020_0755,A member of our class, Michiyo Shiraishi...passed[r]away last night.[l][p]
d0_020_0756,Okay, okay, calm down. I know this comes as a[r]surprise, but please keep quiet.[l][p]
d0_020_0757,The cause of death is still under investigation,[r]and there's nothing we know for certain at the[r]moment.[l][p]
d0_020_0758,Detailed investigation reports will come from[r]the police. So please don't go spreading any[r]rumors. Got it?[l][p]
d0_020_0759,We're sending everyone home for today. No[r]dilly-dallying on your way. School will be off[r]tomorrow as well.[l][p]
d0_020_0760,Hey, you. Stop celebrating. Show some respect.[l][p]
d0_020_0761,There will be a memorial service scheduled next[r]week at the school assembly. If anyone wishes[r]to pay their respects individually...[l][p]

d0_020_0764,Um... Sorry to bug you...[l][p]
d0_020_0765,It's just... You seem a little different from[r]your usual self...[l][p]
d0_020_0766,I hope I'm not being a nosy...[l][p]
d0_020_0767,Ah... Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.[l][p]
d0_020_0768,Uh... You're Kurosuzu, right? The transfer[r]student.[l][p]
d0_020_0769,Yes. But, um...[l][p]
d0_020_0770,You usually call me Mio...[l][p]
d0_020_0771,I do?[r]Right, sorry...[l][p]
d0_020_0772,There's just so much happening, I think I'm[r]having trouble thinking straight.[l][p]
d0_020_0773,But... Thanks, Mio.[l][p]
d0_020_0774,Was I acting that strangely?[l][p]
d0_020_0775,Yeah... Enough to make me worry.[l][p]
d0_020_0776,If you want to talk... I'm happy to listen.[l][p]
d0_020_0777,Yeah, this is perfect timing.[l][p]
d0_020_0778,There's actually something I want to ask you.[l][p]
d0_020_0779,Yeah?[l][p]
d0_020_0780,Um... You know that spirit board thing that[r]everyone's been doing?[l][p]
d0_020_0781,Where you summon a spirit and ask it whatever[r]you want.[l][p]
d0_020_0782,Ah... Yeah, I know it.[l][p]
d0_020_0783,I want to try it out.[r]There's something I want to know...[l][p]
d0_020_0784,Why are you telling me this?[l][p]
d0_020_0785,I mean...[l][p]
d0_020_0786,You seem like the type to know about this stuff.[l][p]
d0_020_0787,Oh... I do?[l][p]
d0_020_0788,Yeah. You look like you're really into that occult[r]stuff. You know, you've got that kind of gloomy[r]look.[l][p]
d0_020_0789,Huh... I don't know how I should feel about[r]that...[l][p]
d0_020_0790,But you do know how to do it, right?[l][p]
d0_020_0791,Well, yes... I think I probably know a little[r]more than most.[l][p]
d0_020_0792,Okay, please help me! You're my only hope![l][p]
d0_020_0793,Hmm...[l][p]
d0_020_0794,Um... The thing you want to ask, is it...?[l][p]
d0_020_0795,Yeah. I want to know about the truth behind[r]Michiyo's death.[l][p]
d0_020_0796,And where the Rite of Resurrection is hidden.[l][p]
d0_020_0797,I see...[l][p]
d0_020_0798,Hmm...[l][p]
d0_020_0799,I don't know if getting the answer to those[r]questions will be as easy as you hope...[l][p]
d0_020_0800,Please! The teachers and police aren't any help,[r]and there's only so much I can do alone![l][p]
d0_020_0801,If there's even the slightest chance, then...![l][p]
d0_020_0802,Well...[l][p]
d0_020_0803,Ok. If that would make you feel better, then I'll[r]help.[l][p]
d0_020_0804,Yes! Thank you, Mio.[l][p]
d0_020_0805,Okay, then tomorrow after dark...[l][p]
d0_020_0806,Hey, Mio?[l][p]
d0_020_0807,You know about the Rite of Resurrection, right?[l][p]
d0_020_0808,Um... Yeah. It's that thing Mr. Araishi apparently[r]discovered and wrote an article about.[l][p]
d0_020_0809,I doubt there's many people who don't know,[r]he's always talking about it.[l][p]
d0_020_0810,Do you...believe it's real?[l][p]
d0_020_0811,Huh...?[l][p]
d0_020_0812,Well, um...[l][p]
d0_020_0813,It sounds a little too good to be true to me...[l][p]
d0_020_0814,But, on the off chance that it really works?[l][p]
d0_020_0815,We could bring Michiyo back to life with it![l][p]
d0_020_0816,I want to find it if there's even the slightest[r]chance of bringing Michiyo back![l][p]
d0_020_0817,But...how will you look for it?[l][p]
d0_020_0818,Right. That's the thing...[l][p]
d0_020_0819,Michiyo, she...[l][p]
d0_020_0820,I wonder why she had to die...[l][p]
d0_020_0821,...[l][p]
d0_020_0822,She didn't leave a note or anything, but they[r]announced that it was a suicide.[l][p]
d0_020_0823,That can't be right![r]She would never kill herself![l][p]
d0_020_0824,Michiyo was so happy, and always looked on the[r]bright side of things... She loved coming to[r]school![l][p]
d0_020_0825,I know she was going through some hard times,[r]but for her to kill herself?[l][p]
d0_020_0826,...[l][p]
d0_020_0827,I never got a chance to speak with her...[l][p]
d0_020_0828,She was often absent from school... And when she[r]did come in, she looked depressed...[l][p]
d0_020_0829,...[l][p]
d0_020_0830,...You're right.[l][p]
d0_020_0831,And that's why everyone was so willing to accept[r]that she committed suicide.[l][p]
d0_020_0832,They acted like they cared, but all they did was[r]gossip about it.[l][p]
d0_020_0833,They put together little pieces of information and[r]spread rumors like it's the truth.[l][p]
d0_020_0834,Isn't that terrible?[l][p]
d0_020_0835,Yes, it is...[l][p]
d0_020_0836,I've heard some that are really awful.[l][p]
d0_020_0837,In the end, the only reason they're able to say[r]stuff like that is 'cause they aren't personally[r]involved.[l][p]
d0_020_0838,It's true that she didn't get along with her new[r]stepdad and that her grades went down...[l][p]
d0_020_0839,But to say things like, "How sad! No wonder she[r]killed herself!" How dare they![l][p]
d0_020_0840,She always told me she was okay whenever I[r]talked with her because I was worried.[l][p]
d0_020_0841,She would have told me if there was something[r]bothering her so badly she'd kill herself over it![l][p]
d0_020_0842,Uh-huh...[l][p]
d0_020_0843,I won't let Michiyo's death be written off like[r]this![l][p]
d0_020_0844,Like... maybe she got caught up in something bad.[l][p]
d0_020_0845,Something bad?[l][p]
d0_020_0846,People have been talking about that body found in[r]Former Yasuda Gardens, right?[l][p]
d0_020_0847,Some are saying that this town is cursed or[r]something.[l][p]
d0_020_0848,Yes, there has been a strange feeling around[r]things recently.[l][p]

d0_020_0859,Yes. As far as I can tell, you aren't experiencing[r]any negative effects.[l][p]
d0_020_0860,I think it was just a mild shock from how sudden[r]it was.[l][p]
d0_020_0861,Huh...[l][p]
d0_020_0862,Ah...! Was everything okay with the spirit!?[l][p]
d0_020_0863,Yep. It was almost bad, but I got it to leave.[l][p]

d0_020_0865,Hm? In my hand?[l][p]

d0_020_0872,Could you tell me what you heard?[r]Anything you can recall.[l][p]
d0_020_0873,I think it might be connected to that object.[l][p]
d0_020_0874,Um, let's see...[l][p]
d0_020_0875,It felt like I was at the bottom of a dark[r]place... Then this voice felt like it was echoing[r]in my mind.[l][p]
d0_020_0876,After that, it just kept shouting "Kill them!"[l][p]
d0_020_0877,I see... Thank you.[l][p]
d0_020_0878,Yakko?[l][p]
d0_020_0879,I think you may have exactly what you need in[r]order to use the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
d0_020_0880,A curse with the power to take people's lives[r]and turn them into soul dregs.[l][p]
d0_020_0881,What!? You mean this is a real curse?[l][p]
d0_020_0882,I know I said I wanted to use the Rite of[r]Resurrection to bring back Michiyo, but...[l][p]
d0_020_0883,But why!?[r]Why me? It makes no sense![l][p]
d0_020_0884,...[l][p]
d0_020_0885,Yakko.[r]Please calm down and listen.[l][p]
d0_020_0886,But how can I!? I mean—[l][p]
d0_020_0887,You might be used to these kind of things Mio, but[r]I'm not![l][p]
d0_020_0888,I didn't even really believe in the occult, much[r]less think that the spirit board would actually work![l][p]
d0_020_0889,But now after something like that what choice do[r]I have but to believe![l][p]
d0_020_0890,And not only that, but a curse that can kill[r]people?[l][p]
d0_020_0891,What am I supposed to do about that!?[l][p]
d0_020_0892,I know. It's only natural to feel that way. Anyone[r]would feel confused.[l][p]

d0_020_0901,I... Yeah.[l][p]
d0_020_0902,I'm sorry about panicking.[l][p]
d0_020_0903,No, it's okay.[l][p]
d0_020_0904,Fear is something we feel in the face of the[r]unknown.[l][p]
d0_020_0905,Long ago, people would give names to phenomena[r]they couldn't understand in order to live with[r]them.[l][p]
d0_020_0906,...?[l][p]
d0_020_0907,However, modern-day developments in science and[r]culture have pushed for the rejection of[r]things that can't be measured.[l][p]
d0_020_0908,And so, the paranormal has been treated like[r]it doesn't exist.[l][p]
d0_020_0909,But they've been around since a long, long time[r]ago.[l][p]
d0_020_0910,If you just understand, you can see that there's[r]nothing to be afraid of.[l][p]
d0_020_0911,First, calming down is the most important. Accept[r]reality for what it is.[l][p]
d0_020_0912,Huh...[l][p]
d0_020_0913,I only really gave this stuff a shot 'cause it was[r]popular, but...[l][p]
d0_020_0914,You really do have a connection with this stuff,[r]don't you.[l][p]
d0_020_0915,Well... I suppose to an extent.[l][p]
d0_020_0916,Hey, Mio? What do I do?[r]Where do I start?[l][p]
d0_020_0917,Am I cursed? Am I going to die?[l][p]
d0_020_0918,It's okay. I'll take care of the curse.[l][p]
d0_020_0919,That's...why I'm here in the first place.[l][p]
d0_020_0920,What...?[l][p]
d0_020_0921,Trust me.[l][p]
d0_020_0922,I'll take care of things, it'll be all right.[l][p]
d0_020_0923,Thanks...[l][p]
d0_020_0924,I was the one who dragged you along to do[r]the spirit board...[l][p]
d0_020_0925,It's fine. You're desperate to find a way to try[r]and help your friend.[l][p]
d0_020_0926,But spirit boards are dangerous.[r]You have to take them seriously.[l][p]
d0_020_0927,So I'm glad you invited me.[l][p]
d0_020_0928,All right, let's review everything we've learned[r]so far and think of how to move forward.[l][p]
d0_020_0929,Okay.[l][p]
d0_020_0930,What is this curse?[r]Am I cursed?[l][p]
d0_020_0931,Well...[l][p]
d0_020_0932,I've only looked into it a little.[l][p]
d0_020_0933,But I wouldn't quite say you're cursed.[l][p]
d0_020_0934,It's more like you've gained the ability to use[r]the power of a curse.[l][p]
d0_020_0935,So, there shouldn't be any kind of negative[r]paranormal effect on you.[l][p]
d0_020_0936,The power to use a curse...?[r]Do you mean this curse stone?[l][p]
d0_020_0937,Yes. If the curse stone is used under certain[r]conditions...[l][p]
d0_020_0938,A curse will be placed on someone, taking their[r]life and turning it into soul dregs.[l][p]
d0_020_0939,Soul dregs are said to be required to enact the[r]Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
d0_020_0940,Normally, a curse is a spell that would only be[r]usable by onmyoji of considerable talent.[l][p]
d0_020_0941,I believe that curse stone makes it so that even[r]normal people can use them.[l][p]
d0_020_0942,So someone like me with no knowledge could curse[r]someone?[l][p]
d0_020_0943,Yes. But it's still nothing to take lightly. You could[r]end up having it redirected right at you.[l][p]
d0_020_0944,To tell you the truth, something unusual did[r]happen while we were using the spirit board.[l][p]
d0_020_0945,It happened right around midnight, I think.[l][p]
d0_020_0946,This whole area seems to be under the effect[r]of the Feast of Shadows.[l][p]
d0_020_0947,The Feast of Shadows...?[l][p]
d0_020_0948,Yes. It's a type of spell that temporarily[r]boosts the potency of the supernatural.[l][p]
d0_020_0949,It also has the effect of making the powers of[r]certain curse echoes manifest more easily.[l][p]
d0_020_0950,Judging by its strength...I'd say it probably[r]covers about a three to four-kilometer radius.[l][p]
d0_020_0951,Three to four kilometers...? That's big enough to[r]cover all of Sumida City.[l][p]
d0_020_0952,Yes. I think the Feast of Shadows was used to[r]cause the resentment lingering in the area to[r]manifest as curse stones.[l][p]
d0_020_0953,Someone did this.[l][p]
d0_020_0954,But who?[l][p]
d0_020_0955,I don't know enough to say.[l][p]
d0_020_0956,But it's likely that it was done by someone who[r]wants to uncover the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
d0_020_0957,This isn't something to happen naturally.[l][p]
d0_020_0958,I see...[l][p]
d0_020_0959,A curse stone's powers can only be used in this[r]area under the influence of the Feast of Shadows.[l][p]
d0_020_0960,The effects also only appear [c3]after the sun has[r]set[c0]. By setting a limit on when they can be used, the[r]curses are strengthened.[l][p]
d0_020_0961,So the curses can't be used outside this area or[r]during the day?[l][p]
d0_020_0962,Correct. But speaking of limits...[l][p]
d0_020_0963,To actually use a curse to kill someone, it seems[r]there are conditions that need to be met.[l][p]
d0_020_0964,Conditions...?[l][p]
d0_020_0965,You mean like how my curse echo needs someone[r]to listen to the sound it makes for thirty[r]seconds?[l][p]
d0_020_0966,To be honest, I don't really understand it.[l][p]
d0_020_0967,Like, how do I even summon the curse echo or[r]make the sound...?[l][p]
d0_020_0968,Do I just, like...will it?[l][p]
d0_020_0969,Do you mind if I try?[l][p]
d0_020_0970,Stop, stop, stop! You shouldn't be using curses so[r]willy-nilly![l][p]
d0_020_0971,Even if there are conditions that have to be met,[r]the power to kill someone without leaving behind[r]evidence is dangerous enough.[l][p]
d0_020_0972,In that sense, maybe you really have been cursed.[l][p]
d0_020_0973,...[l][p]
d0_020_0974,I'm sorry that you got wrapped up in this[r]situation even though I'm here with you...[l][p]
d0_020_0975,That curse stone... I think whoever holds it[r]becomes a curse bearer.[l][p]
d0_020_0976,It would probably be best for me to hold onto it,[r]but...[l][p]
d0_020_0977,Then I'd feel bad about forcing it on you...[l][p]
d0_020_0978,No... I sense a powerful force rejecting me.[r]I don't think I'd be able to take it.[l][p]
d0_020_0979,Really? Why?[l][p]
d0_020_0980,If we tried separating it from you, the curse may[r]trigger.[l][p]
d0_020_0981,That's how bad I sense it wants to stay with you.[l][p]
d0_020_0982,No way...[l][p]
d0_020_0983,That curse stone might look like nothing more[r]than an old netsuke carving.[l][p]
d0_020_0984,But I can sense a powerful, resentful energy from[r]it. I don't think it's a good idea for me to even[r]touch it.[l][p]
d0_020_0985,I may seem like I know what I'm doing, but I don't[r]know how to handle something this powerful.[l][p]
d0_020_0986,Really? This little thing?[l][p]
d0_020_0987,If you threw it away and someone with bad ideas[r]picked it up, it could be bad.[l][p]
d0_020_0988,I think it would be safer to avoid the risk of[r]getting anyone else involved and have you hold[r]on to it for now.[l][p]
d0_020_0989,Well now I'm kind of freaked out...[l][p]
d0_020_0990,Anyways, we need to make it to daybreak...[l][p]
d0_020_0991,I think the curse should weaken once it's[r]morning. I'll help you find a way to deal with[r]it then.[l][p]
d0_020_0992,Okay...[l][p]
d0_020_0993,So there are two things you should remember.[l][p]
d0_020_0994,First, do not fulfill the conditions while it's[r]night.[l][p]
d0_020_0995,Second, should you happen to fulfill the[r]conditions, don't use the curse.[l][p]
d0_020_0996,R-right.[l][p]
d0_020_0997,The mysterious voice said the curse stone is[r]called the Fool's Procession, right?[l][p]
d0_020_0998,Yeah. That's from the Seven Mysteries of Honjo,[r]right?[l][p]
d0_020_0999,Our school is said to be connected with a story[r]with the same name, one of the Mysteries.[l][p]
d0_020_1000,Right. I don't think it's a coincidence.[l][p]
d0_020_1001,This is just a guess, but...[l][p]
d0_020_1002,It's possible that you were chosen because it[r]could feel your desire for the Rite of[r]Resurrection.[l][p]
d0_020_1003,...[l][p]
d0_020_1004,If this is a curse of the Seven Mysteries of[r]Honjo...[l][p]
d0_020_1005,Then it's possible that there are others who[r]received curses associated with the other[r]Mysteries.[l][p]
d0_020_1006,Yeah... That voice also said that there are other[r]curse bearers or whatever you called them.[l][p]
d0_020_1007,Not only that...[l][p]
d0_020_1008,Apparently you can get a lot of soul dregs by[r]killing a curse bearer.[l][p]
d0_020_1009,Right... That's certainly not good.[l][p]
d0_020_1010,Even if we have no intention of killing others[r]with the curse...[l][p]
d0_020_1011,There's a chance you may be targeted if other[r]curse bearers find us.[l][p]
d0_020_1012,Eep...![l][p]
d0_020_1013,We'll have to avoid anyone who has another of the[r]curses.[l][p]
d0_020_1014,That means we should avoid people at night as[r]much as possible.[l][p]
d0_020_1015,...[l][p]
d0_020_1016,But Mio...[l][p]
d0_020_1017,Yes?[l][p]
d0_020_1018,If this curse is real...[l][p]
d0_020_1019,That means I could bring back Michiyo if I used[r]it, right?[l][p]
d0_020_1020,The Rite of Resurrection would be real too...[l][p]
d0_020_1021,Y-yes, that's true.[l][p]
d0_020_1022,But you can't do that, Yakko.[l][p]
d0_020_1023,But...[l][p]
d0_020_1024,It feels like it's not the time to worry about[r]that kind of stuff.[l][p]
d0_020_1025,If Michiyo died in an accident, then I'm sure she[r]didn't want to die.[l][p]
d0_020_1026,What's the issue with putting a little curse on a[r]complete stranger?[l][p]
d0_020_1027,I sort of feel like it wouldn't be a big deal.[l][p]
d0_020_1028,What's going on with you?[r]You're not acting like yourself, Yakko.[l][p]
d0_020_1029,You would never even consider taking the life of[r]another person.[l][p]
d0_020_1030,...[l][p]
d0_020_1031,Is it the curse's influence on you...? Maybe the[r]curse echo's grudge is rubbing off on you...?[l][p]
d0_020_1032,Will you show me it for a second?[l][p]
d0_020_1033,Hm?[l][p]
d0_020_1034,Is there...something inside it?[l][p]
d0_020_1035,No! Stop![l][p]
d0_020_1036,Yakko...?[l][p]
d0_020_1037,Oh... I'm sorry.[l][p]
d0_020_1038,But...it's like...[l][p]
d0_020_1039,I just suddenly really didn't want you to[r]touch it.[l][p]
d0_020_1040,...[l][p]
d0_020_1041,I understand. I'm sorry.[l][p]
d0_020_1042,But you need to give up on the Rite of[r]Resurrection.[l][p]
d0_020_1043,What...?[l][p]
d0_020_1044,Because that's the real curse.[l][p]
d0_020_1045,Using resurrection as a lure, it tempts curse[r]bearers into using their curses.[l][p]
d0_020_1046,...[l][p]
d0_020_1047,You have to resist it.[l][p]
d0_020_1048,Don't let yourself be deceived by some curse.[l][p]
d0_020_1049,...[l][p]
d0_020_1050,But Michiyo could...[l][p]
d0_020_1051,I think for tonight we should get you home to[r]rest. I'll walk you.[l][p]
d0_020_1052,The curse's influence should subside in the[r]morning...[l][p]
d0_020_1053,...[l][p]
d0_020_1054,Okay.[l][p]
d0_020_1055,I'm sorry, but I'm telling you that you need to[r]give up on the Rite.[l][p]
d0_020_1056,It's beyond us... Even a single curse stone[r]alone is too much to handle...[l][p]
d0_020_1057,...[l][p]
d0_020_1058,Bringing back the dead isn't something so simple.[l][p]
d0_020_1059,I know how much it hurts, but please focus on just[r]worrying about surviving tonight.[l][p]
d0_020_1060,Even now, we're in great danger.[l][p]
d0_020_1061,...[l][p]
d0_020_1062,Okay. Let's get going then, shall we?[l][p]
d0_020_1063,We'll take the same route we took to get here.[l][p]
d0_020_1064,R-right.[l][p]
d0_020_1065,We'll be fine, right...?[r]There's no one else at school, is there?[l][p]
d0_020_1066,I think so...[l][p]
d0_020_1067,The night-shift janitor shouldn't be patrolling[r]this late at night either.[l][p]
d0_020_1068,Aaah![l][p]
d0_020_1069,Huh...? What?[r]Why'd the lights go out!?[l][p]
d0_020_1070,Mio...? Are you okay?[l][p]
d0_020_1071,Hello? Mio?[l][p]
d0_020_1072,She's not here...? What's happening!?[l][p]
d0_020_1073,Where... Where are you?[l][p]
d0_020_1074,Aaaaaah!!!
d0_020_1075,Huh!? Oh no, oh no, oh no![r]What was that?[l][p]
d0_020_1076,Get me out of here! Mio?[r]Mio! Mio, where are you!?[l][p]
d0_020_1077,Yakko! I'm here![l][p]
d0_020_1078,Over here! Can you see me?[l][p]
d0_020_1079,Huh? Where...?[r]I can't see anything...[l][p]
d0_020_1080,Not that way Yakko.[r]Behind you! I'm behind you![l][p]
d0_020_1081,Turn around this way![l][p]
d0_020_1082,It's pitch black, I have no idea which way I'm[r]facing![l][p]
d0_020_1083,There you are, Mio![l][p]
d0_020_1084,This way! Over here![l][p]
d0_020_1085,Be careful! Your field of vision is being limited![l][p]
d0_020_1086,R-right![l][p]
d0_030_0001,Start from beginning

d0_030_0105,I'm not acting out.
d0_030_0207,I'm waiting for someone.
d0_030_0208,I forgot something.
d0_030_0213,What are you doing here?

d0_030_0511,Hey, Mio...? What was that just now?[l][p]
d0_030_0512,Could it be another curse echo different from[r]mine...?[l][p]
d0_030_0513,I...think so, yes.[l][p]
d0_030_0514,We may have been discovered by another curse[r]bearer.[l][p]
d0_030_0515,Oh...[l][p]
d0_030_0516,Hm...?[l][p]
d0_030_0517,What's wrong?[l][p]
d0_030_0518,Shhh...[l][p]
d0_030_0519,Someone's there...in that classroom...[l][p]
d0_030_0520,What...!?[l][p]
d0_030_0521,Something moved inside...[l][p]
d0_030_0522,Well...[l][p]
d0_030_0523,We don't need to check it out, right?[r]Let's hurry and get out of here.[l][p]
d0_030_0524,Maybe...[l][p]
d0_030_0525,The person who used that curse echo may be in[r]there.[l][p]
d0_030_0526,If we could just see who it is, it could help us[r]later.[l][p]
d0_030_0527,Right...[r]Okay, just a glimpse. Be careful.[l][p]
d0_030_0528,It might be the curse bearer who used that[r]curse echo just now.[l][p]
d0_030_0529,If we can see who it is, it might help us decide[r]what to do later.[l][p]
d0_030_0530,That's true...[l][p]
d0_030_0531,Okay, be careful...[l][p]
d0_030_0532,Well? Can you see anything?[l][p]
d0_030_0533,Try and get a look around.[l][p]
d0_030_0534,Ah...![l][p]
d0_030_0535,Huh...?[l][p]
d0_030_0536,Is that...our homeroom teacher [c4]Mr. Jonouchi[c0]?[l][p]
d0_030_0537,And the person with him is...[r][c4]Hitomi[c0] from Class A?[l][p]
d0_030_0538,...![l][p]
d0_030_0539,What...?[l][p]
d0_030_0540,Oh, my... Wh-what is going on here?[l][p]
d0_030_0541,Aaah...![l][p]
d0_030_0542,That bastard![l][p]
d0_030_0543,He's at it again![l][p]
d0_030_0544,I have to kill him![l][p]
d0_030_0545,I won't let him get away with this...![l][p]
d0_030_0546,What...?[l][p]
d0_030_0547,The curse![r]I could kill him with it![l][p]
d0_030_0548,No, Yakko! You can't use the curse stone![l][p]
d0_030_0549,What's gotten into you? Resist it![l][p]
d0_030_0550,Who's there!?[r]Is someone there?[l][p]
d0_030_0551,This is bad! We have to go before they see us![l][p]
d0_030_0552,Hey...![l][p]
d0_030_0553,Die... Die, Mr. Jonouchi![l][p]
d0_030_0554,Wh-what is this sound?[l][p]
d0_030_0555,No, Yakko! Stop![r]You'll kill Hitomi too![l][p]
d0_030_0556,I have to do something... Hah![l][p]
d0_030_0557,Hm!? Hey! Over there![r]Who's there!?[l][p]
d0_030_0558,Ah... I was seen!? It didn't work![l][p]
d0_030_0559,Run! Hurry![l][p]
d0_030_0560,Haah... Haah...![l][p]
d0_030_0561,Haah... Haah...![l][p]
d0_030_0562,It seems like they're not coming after us...[l][p]
d0_030_0563,Let's hope they didn't see our faces.[l][p]
d0_030_0564,But Yakko...[r]What came over you all of a sudden?[l][p]
d0_030_0565,Haah...haah...sorry.[r]Thanks for stopping me...[l][p]
d0_030_0566,It's like...this uncontrollable rage suddenly[r]welled up inside me...[l][p]
d0_030_0567,I wonder what's gotten into me. I can barely even[r]remember what happened.[l][p]
d0_030_0568,I'm really sorry...[l][p]
d0_030_0569,I do think it's partly the curse's influence on[r]you, but we certainly saw something shocking...[l][p]
d0_030_0570,My heart's still pounding...[l][p]
d0_030_0571,I'm a little surprised you know Hitomi from[r]Class A.[l][p]
d0_030_0572,She tends to stand out a lot.[l][p]
d0_030_0573,Gotcha. Well, she certainly does dress like a[r]delinquent. Though she barely shows up to school.[l][p]
d0_030_0574,But could Mr. Jonouchi or Hitomi really be a[r]curse bearer?[l][p]
d0_030_0575,I don't know...[r]But we should be careful just in case.[l][p]
d0_030_0576,...Yakko.[l][p]
d0_030_0577,Hm?[l][p]
d0_030_0578,When I give the signal... Run.[l][p]
d0_030_0579,Go straight for the entrance. Don't look back,[r]no matter what.[l][p]
d0_030_0580,Huh...?[l][p]
d0_030_0581,Why?[r]Did something happen?[l][p]
d0_030_0582,Something happened, didn't it!?[r]What about you, Mio?[l][p]
d0_030_0583,I'll be fine.[r]We'll meet up outside the school gates.[l][p]
d0_030_0584,If I'm not there in ten minutes, go straight home,[r]okay?[l][p]
d0_030_0585,...Okay! Go![l][p]
d0_030_0586,R-right![l][p]
d0_030_0587,[s0][a0.5]<i>Don't look back...[r]Don't look back...!
d0_030_0588,Haah.... Haah...[l][p]
d0_030_0589,I have to get outside.[l][p]
d0_030_0590,Let's see... To get to the gates, I go by the[r]gym and—[l][p]
d0_030_0591,Hm? What are you doing, Miss?
d0_030_0592,Eek![l][p]
d0_030_0593,You shouldn't be here this late.[r]Don't ya know what time it is?[l][p]
d0_030_0594,Oh... [c4]Mr. Ashimiya[c0].[l][p]
d0_030_0595,Well, if it isn't little Yakko.[l][p]
d0_030_0596,Anyways, students ain't supposed to be outside[r]playin' around at night.[l][p]

d0_030_0599,I know you're rough around the edges, but I didn't[r]take you for one to act out like this.[l][p]
d0_030_0600,Sorry...[r]I forgot something back in the classroom...[l][p]
d0_030_0601,Hm? No sass today, huh?[r]Realized you were in the wrong, did you?[l][p]
d0_030_0602,Yes...[l][p]
d0_030_0603,Forgot somethin' in your classroom, huh?[r]You're a piece o' work.[l][p]
d0_030_0604,I'm not acting out... What about you? Should you[r]be smoking on school grounds?[l][p]
d0_030_0605,Ahh... Well it ain't lit, so it's all right.[r]It's, y'know, an accessory.[l][p]
d0_030_0606,Hey, don't go changin' the subject. There's just[r]no lettin' my guard down with you.[l][p]
d0_030_0607,So? Why are ya here so late?[l][p]
d0_030_0608,Well, um...[l][p]
d0_030_0609,The truth is, I...forgot something in my[r]classroom.[l][p]
d0_030_0610,Again? You sure are a piece o' work.[l][p]
d0_030_0611,Hm...?[l][p]
d0_030_0612,But, you don't have nothin' with you.[l][p]
d0_030_0613,Oh...[l][p]
d0_030_0614,Wait... You do.[r]What's that in your hand?[l][p]
d0_030_0615,Huh?[l][p]
d0_030_0616,Well, um...[r]This is what I forgot.[l][p]
d0_030_0617,I, uh, got it from my grandpa. It's really[r]important to me.[l][p]
d0_030_0618,Hmph. Girls these days sure have weird tastes.[l][p]
d0_030_0619,Well, okay. Better head straight home if you're[r]done. I won't tell on ya.[l][p]
d0_030_0620,No, wait... I can't let you walk home alone this[r]late.[l][p]
d0_030_0621,All right, wait just a little. I'll hurry and lock[r]things up.[l][p]
d0_030_0622,Ah... But...[l][p]
d0_030_0623,Oh, right! Mr. Jonouchi was actually looking for[r]you inside the main building![l][p]
d0_030_0624,Whazzat? He's here right now?[r]What's he thinkin'!?[l][p]
d0_030_0625,I don't know... He was in Class 3B on the[r]second floor just a bit ago.[l][p]
d0_030_0626,Well, I suppose that means I can't be lockin'[r]up yet.[l][p]
d0_030_0627,Second floor, you said? I'll go take a peek.[r]Be back in a jiff.[l][p]
d0_030_0628,Um. My house is really close by. I'll be fine on[r]my own. Really.[l][p]
d0_030_0629,That so? Ah, the snack shop, right?[l][p]
d0_030_0630,S'pose you'll be fine then.[r]Be careful now, y'hear?[l][p]
d0_030_0631,Stay on the big, well-lit streets. If something[r]happens, shout "Fire!"[l][p]
d0_030_0632,Okay! You worry too much.[l][p]
d0_030_0633,Well... We wouldn't want to be losing any more[r]students.[l][p]
d0_030_0634,Though I imagine you'd know that better than[r]anyone.[l][p]
d0_030_0635,Yes... You're right.[l][p]
d0_030_0636,Um...[r]Actually, a friend of mine is still inside.[l][p]
d0_030_0637,I think they'll be here soon.[l][p]
d0_030_0638,That so? Who's your friend?[l][p]
d0_030_0639,Um... My classmate Mio Kurosuzu.[l][p]
d0_030_0640,Ah, that transfer student?[l][p]
d0_030_0641,Breakin' school rules already, huh? Didn't take[r]her for the type.[l][p]
d0_030_0642,No, I was the one who dragged her here.[l][p]
d0_030_0643,Well, whatever. I'll go take a look. It'll be[r]safer if ya go home together.[l][p]
d0_030_0644,Oh... Right.[l][p]
d0_030_0645,She's in the first-floor hallways. Be careful,[r]though, you don't know what may be there.[l][p]
d0_030_0646,Whazzat supposed to mean? First floor, yeah?[r]I'll be right back.[l][p]

d0_030_0689,Ah-ha! It must be that transfer student![l][p]
d0_030_0690,She has it, you know![l][p]
d0_030_0691,You must as well! Take out what's in your[r]pocket and show it to me![l][p]
d0_030_0692,Um...[r]I came to get something I forgot at school...[l][p]
d0_030_0693,This late at night?[r]It couldn't wait until tomorrow?[l][p]

d0_030_0700,U-um...! It's not...![l][p]
d0_030_0701,That netsuke is of great historical importance[r]to the area.[l][p]

d0_030_0704,You're hurting me, Mr. Araishi![r]Stop pulling me![l][p]

first_0074,Breaking News
first_0076,[c30]Announcer
first_0080,[c10]The Storyteller
first_0165,...Ah, you are here.[r]Welcome, welcome.[l][p]
first_0166,I have been eagerly awaiting your arrival.[l][p]
first_0167,Allow me to introduce myself.[r]I am [c4]the Storyteller[c0].[l][p]
first_0168,Pleased to make your acquaintance.[r]I shall be your guide going forward.[l][p]
first_0169,...Now, then. Before we begin our story, there are[r]several things I must bring to your attention.[l][p]
first_0170,First, this game uses [c3]autosave[c0].[l][p]
first_0171,The game will [c3]automatically save at regular[r]intervals[c0], so you may stop playing at any time.[l][p]
first_0172,Saving is a very important element of games.[r]It is the only way to keep your memories in place.[l][p]
first_0173,If you do not wish to rely on autosave alone,[r]you can also save manually via the menu.[l][p]
first_0174,Next, please look at the upper right of the screen.[r]This is the [c3]Menu button[c0].[l][p]
first_0175,From here, you can check the [c3]Text Log[c0], view useful[r][c3]Files[c0], and switch [c3]Auto Mode[c0] on and off.[l][p]
first_0176,You can also adjust the brightness, volume,[r]and other settings in the [c3]Options[c0] menu.[l][p]
first_0177,For instance, if there is a voice you would prefer[r]not to hear, you can mute it by setting the[r]Voice Volume to 0.[l][p]
first_0178,I suggest you check the brightness, controls,[r]and other settings now before going on.[l][p]
first_0179,I will explain other essential functions when the[r]time is right.[l][p]
first_0180,Ah... There is one more thing I wish to confirm[r]before we continue.[l][p]
first_0181,...Or so I thought, but I've just remembered that[r]your name is [c3][%0][c0], correct?[l][p]
first_0182,Thank you for bearing with me through these[r]introductory remarks you have heard many times before.[l][p]
first_0183,It would feel strange to go on without knowing[r]your name.[l][p]
first_0184,Please, tell me what I may call you.[l][p]
first_0185,I see.[r][c3][%ACCOUNTNAME][c0], is it?
first_0186,I see.[r][c3][%0][c0], is it?
first_0187,...Hm? Are you certain you wish to be called[r][c3][%ACCOUNTNAME][c0]?
first_0188,...Is that so? Understood.[r]Very well. So that is what you wish to be called?[l][p]
first_0189,...Oh! How rude of me. Please pardon my mistake![l][p]
first_0190,I was sure that's what you said, but it seems I[r]was wrong. What came over me...?[l][p]
first_0191,...Let me try again.[r]You wish to be called [c3][%0][c0]?
first_0192,Oh... Did I get it wrong?[r]I must have misheard you.[l][p]
first_0193,Could I trouble you to tell me your name once more?[l][p]
first_0194,I'll not get it wrong again.[r][c3][%0][c0] is your name, correct?
first_0195,I see. Very good.[r]I seem to have gotten it right this time.[l][p]
first_0196,All right. Now that we've been properly introduced,[r]let us begin our story.[l][p]
first_0197,<cspace=-4px><color=#ccc><font="TELOP"><align=center>Presented by[r][%0]
first_0198,Ahem... From antiquity to present day, regardless[r]of how society and civilization evolve...[l][p]
first_0199,[c3]Death[c0] has been a constant presence that none have[r]ever escaped.[l][p]
first_0200,Whether it is one's own, or that of someone close,[r]death is always a difficult thing to accept.[l][p]
first_0201,This is an immutable reality—a value shared by all,[r]no matter the age in which they live.[l][p]
first_0202,In fact, oral traditions reflecting people's[r]fears and prayers regarding death still remain:[r]ghosts, spirits, and so on.[l][p]
first_0203,Similarly, in attempt to defy death...many curses,[r]rituals, and customs have been born, from burning[r]spirit incense to summoning the souls of the dead.[l][p]
first_0204,Some of those secret arts are still being passed[r]down to this day...[l][p]
first_0205,Ah... On that note, [%0].[l][p]
first_0206,This may seem rather abrupt, but...[l][p]
first_0207,Is there someone you wish to bring back from the dead?[l][p]
first_0208,What if...[l][p]
first_0209,What if you had one chance to use the secret art of[r]resurrecting the dead?[l][p]
first_0210,Yes, if you had the power to bring someone back to[r]life, one time and one time only...![l][p]
first_0211,What would you do, [%0]?
first_0212,...[l][p]
first_0213,...I see.[l][p]
first_0214,Very interesting.[l][p]
first_0215,Yes, yes... That is what I thought you would say.[l][p]
first_0216,...Hm? What seems to be the matter?[l][p]
first_0217,Ah... You want to know what this box that has been[r]sitting here is.[l][p]
first_0218,It's quite the curious thing, isn't it?[r]This is called a [c3]color television[c0].[l][p]
first_0219,The world I will be sending you to is full of[r]devices such as this that do not exist in the age[r]you are from.[l][p]
first_0220,In this era, a color television can be found in[r]nearly every household.[l][p]
first_0221,That is not all. For example...[l][p]
first_0222,If a person should wish to contact someone while[r]they are out of their home...[l][p]
first_0223,They use [c3]public telephones[c0] like this that can be[r]found all over the city.[l][p]
first_0224,Can you imagine what life would be like in such a time...?[l][p]
first_0225,I'd be thrilled to have you continue this story,[r][%0].[l][p]
first_0226,After all...that is why you came here, no?[l][p]
first_0227,So, let us begin.[r]I have kept you waiting long enough.[l][p]
first_0228,I present to you PARANORMASIGHT,[r]a bizarre tale surrounding the curse known as[r][c3]the Rite of Resurrection[c0]...[l][p]
first_0229,A peculiar yarn ensnaring nine men and women in a[r]fierce fight for their lives as it unravels.[l][p]
first_0230,Some of the characters appearing within surely[r]share your views on the Rite of Resurrection...[l][p]
first_0231,I imagine those who have lost someone dear to them[r]will feel particularly strongly about it,[r]clinging to it as their last desperate hope.[l][p]
first_0232,The first I shall introduce, a man named[r][c4]Shogo Okiie[c0], is one of them.[l][p]
first_0233,...Oh? I wonder what it could be at such a time.[l][p]
first_0234,...Early this morning, the body of a drowned man[r]was discovered at a park in Sumida City...[l][p]
first_0235,Police have identified the body as Shogo Okiie,[r]a 25-year-old man who worked at a company in the area.[l][p]
first_0236,As signs of a struggle were found, the Sumida[r]Police suspect foul play, and have launched an[r]investigation—[l][p]
first_0237,Oh! Excuse me![r]Please, pay no mind to what you have just seen.[l][p]
first_0238,Goodness... You very nearly saw something that[r]would have spoiled the story...[l][p]
first_0239,Just...pretend you did not see that. Let us turn[r]back time back a smidge and start again from there.[l][p]
first_0240,Do you understand? You saw nothing.[l][p]
first_0241,You know nothing...[l][p]

a1_010_0013,My, my...[l][p]
a1_010_0014,Finally, you have arrived at this juncture.[r]I expected no less from you.[l][p]
a1_010_0015,That would mean that you have managed to bring[r]everything to light.[l][p]
a1_010_0016,Though there is the possibility that you have[r]wound up here by chance.[l][p]
a1_010_0017,So before I take you any further...I must ask[r]you a number of questions.[l][p]
a1_010_0018,About what exactly the soul, body, and mind[r]of Seiman Tsuchimikado are.[l][p]
a1_010_0019,Firstly...[l][p]
a1_010_0020,Which curse echo represents the soul[r]of Seiman Tsuchimikado?
a1_010_0021,The Whispering Canal
a1_010_0022,The Fool's Procession
a1_010_0023,The Beckoning Light
a1_010_0024,The Haunting Clappers
a1_010_0025,The Evergreen Beech
a1_010_0026,The Taiko of Tsugaru
a1_010_0027,The Foot-Washing Mansion
a1_010_0028,The One-Sided Reed
a1_010_0029,The Everburning Lantern
a1_010_0030,Aah... It troubles me that you would answer[r]this question incorrectly...[l][p]
a1_010_0031,No... Perhaps I simply misheard you.[l][p]
a1_010_0032,Would you answer once more for me?[l][p]
a1_010_0033,Yes... That is exactly it.[l][p]
a1_010_0034,After his defeat at the hands of Ashino in the[r]Honjo Incident, Seiman wandered about near Ho'onji.[l][p]
a1_010_0035,The form of his curse echo changed over time with[r]the legend he left behind.[l][p]
a1_010_0036,This is the curse echo which was acquired by[r]Mayu Chozawa...[l][p]
a1_010_0037,But when called forth by Seiman's body and mind...[r]it appeared momentarily before him.[l][p]
a1_010_0038,Let us continue.[l][p]
a1_010_0039,Who served as the self of Seiman Tsuchimikado?[r]Who was his body, his descendant who carried his[r]blood in their veins?
a1_010_0040,Who is Seiman's self?
a1_010_0041,Ah... Are you toying with me, perhaps?[l][p]
a1_010_0042,I'm afraid humor will not get you far here...[l][p]
a1_010_0043,Please, answer me once more.[l][p]
a1_010_0044,Correct again.[l][p]
a1_010_0045,Although Shogo Okiie was born to an ordinary[r]family, the blood of a distant relative ran thick[r]in his veins.[l][p]
a1_010_0046,In truth, the same is true for Yoko Fukunaga.[l][p]
a1_010_0047,She was also one who had the blood of a distant[r]relative coursing through her.[r]In her case, it was [c3]Ashino[c0].[l][p]
a1_010_0048,Seiman and Ashino... Fated to meet again[r]all these hundreds of years later.[l][p]
a1_010_0049,Now, for my final question.[l][p]
a1_010_0050,Who is the mind of Seiman Tsuchimikado?[r]Tell me the name of the person whose[r]consciousness was directly tied to his.
a1_010_0051,Who is Seiman's consciousness?
a1_010_0052,Oho, I see...[r]You believe it to be [c3][%5][c0]?[l][p]
a1_010_0053,I am afraid that it is not.[l][p]
a1_010_0054,The answer to this is most important...[r]So please, answer me once more.[l][p]
a1_010_0055,Are you saying...you believe it to be [c3]yourself[c0]?[l][p]
a1_010_0056,Are you certain?[l][p]
a1_010_0057,...Yes. You are correct.[r]Finally...you have remembered.[l][p]
a1_010_0058,That's right. You are...
a1_010_0059,[c3]Seiman's consciousness[c0], awoken by the curses and[r]the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
a1_010_0060,However... Having lost your memories, you forgot[r]about the duty assigned to you.[l][p]
a1_010_0061,This is, if I may say so, where I played my part,[r]guiding you through the events of this story.[l][p]
a1_010_0062,As your consciousness was all that was left of you...[l][p]
a1_010_0063,you manipulated time and space by way of the[r]Story Chart, jumping from vessel to vessel...[l][p]
a1_010_0064,and manipulated your hosts' actions by whispering[r][c3]commands[c0] into their ears.[l][p]
a1_010_0065,In doing so, you were able to get the full[r]picture of what needed to be done.[l][p]
a1_010_0066,But...at one point, while still unconscious,[r]you managed to remember your duty.[l][p]
a1_010_0067,The so-called mastermind behind these events...[r]the one who awakened the Rite and the curses...[r]was Yoko Fukunaga, descendant of Ashino herself.[l][p]
a1_010_0068,You [c3]unconsciously activated your curse[c0][r]and killed her.[l][p]
a1_010_0069,How interesting that she awakened Seiman's[r]consciousness at the same time as the curses...[l][p]
a1_010_0070,That was the one and only time she could have[r]been stopped.[l][p]
a1_010_0071,Ah... But...[l][p]
a1_010_0072,Due to your influence on Shogo Okiie's will,[r]Yoko Fukunaga was brought back to life.[l][p]
a1_010_0073,Using the Story Chart to undo her death...[l][p]
a1_010_0074,I led you to believe that it was the work of[r]the Rite of Resurrection itself.[l][p]
a1_010_0075,But as it turns out, seeing what would transpire[r]if the mastermind was not killed at the outset...[l][p]
a1_010_0076,is what ultimately revealed the way to put an end[r]to the curses for good.[l][p]
a1_010_0077,There were certain things which would have[r]answered all your questions...had you noticed them.[l][p]
a1_010_0078,For example, even while under your control,[r]Shogo Okiie willingly used his curse.[l][p]
a1_010_0079,When I asked you early on how many Shogo Okiie[r]had killed...this is what I meant.[l][p]
a1_010_0080,Had you not used the curse...Shogo Okiie would[r]have done so of his own accord.[l][p]
a1_010_0081,Furthermore, Mayu Chozawa was able to recall[r]information which only you knew...[l][p]
a1_010_0082,She was able to do this because she was connected[r]to you through her curse echo—the Beckoning Light.[l][p]
a1_010_0083,Now...[l][p]
a1_010_0084,Allow me to ask you one last question.[l][p]
a1_010_0085,If you, knowing all that you now know...[l][p]
a1_010_0086,had the ability to resurrect one life...[r]what would you do?
a1_010_0087,I'd use it even if I had to sacrifice myself.
a1_010_0088,I'd use it even if I had to sacrifice someone.
a1_010_0089,I'd use it if it came at no cost.
a1_010_0090,I wouldn't want it. Let someone else have it.
a1_010_0091,I wouldn't want it. I would destroy it.
a1_010_0092,Oho... I see, I see.[l][p]
a1_010_0093,I see you have not changed your answer from[r]when I first asked you this question.[l][p]
a1_010_0094,You are nothing if not stalwart.[r]Just like Seiman himself...[l][p]
a1_010_0095,Oho... I see, I see.[l][p]
a1_010_0096,It is understandable that your answer would[r]change after seeing all that you have seen.[l][p]
a1_010_0097,I am pleased that this was not all for naught.[l][p]
a1_010_0098,Oho... I see, I see.[l][p]
a1_010_0099,That was Seiman's original intention.[l][p]
a1_010_0100,I apologize for leaving it out of the options[r]when I first asked you this question.[l][p]
a1_010_0101,Now... It is time to bring things to a close.[l][p]
a1_010_0102,Upon your arrival here, the Rite of Cleansing was[r]activated, dispelling all other rituals and curses.[l][p]
a1_010_0103,Look upon the fruit of your efforts...[l][p]
a1_010_0104,And then we shall leave this world behind for good.[l][p]
a1_010_0105,Thank you, truly, for all the work you have done.[l][p]

a1_010_0108,...Ngah![l][p]
a1_010_0109,Ah... That's what happened...!?[r]I can't believe it...[l][p]
a1_010_0110,I finally understand...[l][p]
a1_010_0111,Yeah... I was the one who did that to Yoko.[l][p]
a1_010_0112,The blood of the onmyoji that's inside me...broke[r]into my consciousness and gave me that curse.[l][p]
a1_010_0113,Yoko was after the Rite of Resurrection...[r]She was the one who awakened the curses of the[r]Seven Mysteries and cast the Feast of Shadows...[l][p]
a1_010_0114,And the only way to stop all of it...[r]was to put a stop to her here.[l][p]
a1_010_0115,Otherwise the Rite of Cleansing might have been[r]negated, too...[l][p]
a1_010_0116,I wonder how much of it was really her doing[r]all those things...[l][p]
a1_010_0117,Yoko...[l][p]
a1_010_0118,I guess that explains why I felt like it was fate[r]when this all started.[l][p]
a1_010_0119,Though she didn't seem to notice...[l][p]
a1_010_0120,I guess things were always destined to end[r]like this...from the moment we met.[l][p]
a1_010_0121,I wish we could've met under different[r]circumstances.[l][p]
a1_010_0122,...No. No point in thinking like that now.[l][p]
a1_010_0123,God, I need a drink.[l][p]

a1_010_0130,It seems that it was all...just a dream...[l][p]
a1_010_0131,I dreamt...that there was such a thing as the[r]Rite of Resurrection...[l][p]
a1_010_0132,Just...a dream.[l][p]
a1_010_0133,I'm sorry to say it, but...there isn't.[l][p]

a1_020_0021,[s0.014]Let me see if I can find out what it is.
a1_020_0022,[s0.014]I had heard you would be absent today.[r]Is there something you need?
a1_020_0023,[s0.014]Well... I seem to have this spirit sense thing[r]all of a sudden...
a1_020_0024,[s0.014]I know it's the sort of thing our chairwoman[r]doesn't approve of, so I thought I'd mention it...
a1_020_0025,[s0.014]You could've called. Didn't think you were the[r]standoffish type. I had to find out from Iwai.
a1_020_0026,[s0.014]Whoops, sorry! I forgot all about my favorite[r]chief inspector...
a1_020_0027,[s0.014]The hell are you planning?
a1_020_0028,[s0.014]Nothing so heinous as you're thinking...
a1_020_0029,[s0.014]I'm only Makoto Ashimiya, after all.[r]Nothing but a lowly janitor.
a1_020_0030,[s0.014]How're things with you?[r]You gettin' along with your daughter?
a1_020_0031,[s0.014]Well, you know... More or less...

b1_010_0018,Good morning, ma'am.[r]How are you feeling?[l][p]
b1_010_0019,Mm... I'm fine.[r]I hope we can make good progress today.[l][p]
b1_010_0020,How's your curse stone looking?[l][p]
b1_010_0021,I haven't felt anything from it since sunrise.[l][p]
b1_010_0022,Interesting. It's possible that its powers can[r]only be unleashed at night then.[l][p]
b1_010_0023,That aside, why are you so late this morning?[l][p]
b1_010_0024,There are unfortunately some things that can't[r]be investigated while the world slumbers.[l][p]
b1_010_0025,But I did get some research done in[r]what limited time I had.[l][p]
b1_010_0026,Very well. Let's talk.[l][p]
b1_010_0027,Entrance
b1_010_0028,Mansion
b1_010_0029,Talk
b1_010_0030,Richter Kai
b1_010_0031,Think
b1_010_0032,Move
b1_010_0033,He's looking a bit tired. He must have been[r]up all night investigating.[l][p]
b1_010_0034,By the way, there's something I wanted to[r]talk to you about.[l][p]
b1_010_0035,And what's that?[l][p]
b1_010_0036,Our current plan is to steal a curse stone[r]that's already absorbed soul dregs, but...[l][p]
b1_010_0037,I'm wondering if it would suffice to not steal,[r]but instead negotiate with a curse bearer[r]and have them use the rite for our purposes?[l][p]
b1_010_0038,Oh?[l][p]
b1_010_0039,I mean...I suppose that would accomplish the[r]same, but do you think it's possible?[l][p]
b1_010_0040,So long as we offer compensation, it may prove[r]much easier than you'd expect.[l][p]
b1_010_0041,Compensation...[l][p]
b1_010_0042,Cash for instance.[l][p]
b1_010_0043,That wouldn't be off the table for a family[r]as rich as the Shigimas, would it?[l][p]
b1_010_0044,Of course. Why, any amount would be fine[r]if it'd get the job done.[l][p]
b1_010_0045,I won't let monetary matters lead me to regrets[r]the way it did back with the ransom.[l][p]
b1_010_0046,Okay. With that option on the table, let's[r]figure out our strategy.[l][p]
b1_010_0047,About the curse bearers
b1_010_0048,About the kidnapping
b1_010_0049,About the serial killings
b1_010_0050,Do you have a curse bearer with whom we can[r]negotiate in mind?[l][p]
b1_010_0051,Not yet. Surprisingly, it seems the other curse[r]bearers haven't been that proactive about[r]collecting soul dregs.[l][p]
b1_010_0052,Did you see the news this morning?[l][p]
b1_010_0053,No, I haven't.[l][p]
b1_010_0054,Overnight, three mysterious deaths were reported[r]in this area.[l][p]
b1_010_0055,They've yet to announce the identities of the[r]bodies found.[l][p]
b1_010_0056,But they've been nicknamed the Honjo Serial[r]Killings. It's garnered quite some attention[r]on the streets.[l][p]
b1_010_0057,Oh my...[l][p]
b1_010_0058,Only three?[l][p]
b1_010_0059,That's what I thought. Even if the victims[r]were curse bearers, just one or two wouldn't[r]be enough soul dregs.[l][p]
b1_010_0060,And for what those curse stones are capable of,[r]a mere three victims seems a little on the low[r]side.[l][p]
b1_010_0061,With this little activity all through the night,[r]the curse bearers must be a cautious bunch.[l][p]
b1_010_0062,What's holding them back? Are we not all after[r]the power of resurrection?[l][p]
b1_010_0063,There may still be some undiscovered victims[r]but it doesn't seem like anyone has gathered[r]enough soul dregs yet.[l][p]
b1_010_0064,We...might have to set up some bait to spur them[r]into action.[l][p]
b1_010_0065,And then we offer them the deal.[l][p]
b1_010_0066,None of the curse bearers seem very proactive.[l][p]
b1_010_0067,I wonder if this situation could be what the[r]mastermind who kicked it all off intended.[l][p]
b1_010_0068,Now that's an interesting theory.[l][p]
b1_010_0069,You think there's someone behind this all?[l][p]
b1_010_0070,You mentioned hearing an agonized voice telling[r]you to kill when you first obtained the curse[r]stone. That doesn't sound like a coincidence to me.[l][p]
b1_010_0071,Someone agitated the curses in this area on[r]purpose. And they are likely after the Rite of[r]Resurrection as well.[l][p]
b1_010_0072,So you're thinking this person is not one of the[r]curse bearers?[l][p]
b1_010_0073,You've got a sharp mind, ma'am.[l][p]
b1_010_0074,Though it might seem obvious for the mastermind[r]to become a curse bearer and collect soul dregs[r]if they were after the rite...[l][p]
b1_010_0075,This would be very risky, since as a curse[r]bearer they themselves would become a target.[l][p]
b1_010_0076,So, it'd actually be more convenient for them[r]if the curse bearers moved less aggressively.[l][p]
b1_010_0077,That's right. But despite that, they've been[r]inciting the curse bearers to commit murders.[r]Why?[l][p]
b1_010_0078,Let's consider this...[l][p]
b1_010_0079,What if the mastermind isn't trying to[r]collect soul dregs themselves?[l][p]
b1_010_0080,You mean their intention was also to steal[r]the souls while the other curse bearers[r]compete with each other from the start?[l][p]
b1_010_0081,Sitting back and observing from the sidelines[r]is the safer course of action.[l][p]
b1_010_0082,Which is why I figured it best for us to attempt[r]the same strategy.[l][p]
b1_010_0083,So, how should we do it?[l][p]
b1_010_0084,There's still reason to suspect the mastermind[r]could be a curse bearer themselves.[l][p]
b1_010_0085,To be honest, I want to keep my distance[r]from whoever it is. There's no telling what kind[r]of power they might possess.[l][p]
b1_010_0086,Whether our aim is to negotiate or steal,[r]we'll have to outpace the mastermind in making contact[r]with the other curse bearers.[l][p]
b1_010_0087,How do you suppose we do so?[l][p]
b1_010_0088,At this point, all we can do is search.[l][p]
b1_010_0089,If there's a mastermind inciting the curse bearers[r]to collect soul dregs...[l][p]
b1_010_0090,Can we be sure there even is a[r]Rite of Resurrection?[l][p]
b1_010_0091,Good question. The rite could be nothing[r]but a myth fabricated to spur the curse bearers[r]into action.[l][p]
b1_010_0092,Seeing it might be for naught, do you[r]want to give up, ma'am?[l][p]
b1_010_0093,...[l][p]
b1_010_0094,Never.[l][p]
b1_010_0095,Understood. After all, we'll never know the truth[r]unless we see it for ourselves.[l][p]
b1_010_0096,But we'll do it without using the curses[r]ourselves.[l][p]
b1_010_0097,By the way, I met a few people who seemed like[r]potential curse bearers last night. I did some[r]investigating into all of them.[l][p]
b1_010_0098,But I only managed to get detailed information[r]on two.[l][p]
b1_010_0099,You're quick. I suppose that's to be[r]expected from an investigator extraordinaire.[l][p]
b1_010_0100,I appreciate the flattery.[l][p]
b1_010_0101,First, there's [c4]Ayame Tono[c0], the girl we talked to[r]before, though she isn't a curse[r]bearer herself.[l][p]
b1_010_0102,She's a student attending T. University of Art.[r]She currently lives alone in an apartment near[r]Midoricho Park.[l][p]
b1_010_0103,You even determined her address?[r]You're not one to be underestimated,[r]Mr. Investigator Extraordinaire.[l][p]
b1_010_0104,I called every single university with ukiyo-e[r]in the curriculum pretending to be her parent.[l][p]
b1_010_0105,I went around to check on her place on the[r]way here. It doesn't seem like she returned home[r]last night.[l][p]
b1_010_0106,I'm worried she might've run into some trouble.[l][p]
b1_010_0107,Didn't you attempt to follow her last night?[l][p]
b1_010_0108,I'm embarrassed to say, but I couldn't. She[r]shook me.[l][p]
b1_010_0109,I couldn't keep track of her...[l][p]
b1_010_0110,And here I thought you were an investigator[r]extraordinaire.[l][p]
b1_010_0111,I'd like to learn more about her,[r]but it would take some time.[l][p]
b1_010_0112,She is planning to steal the curse stones,[r]just like us. It's best we act carefully[r]around her.[l][p]
b1_010_0113,Next is the tall man who was dressed[r]in black.[l][p]
b1_010_0114,I met him near Kinshicho. He stood out[r]with the way he dressed. I managed to get some[r]good information from him.[l][p]
b1_010_0115,Impressive.[l][p]
b1_010_0116,What can I say?[l][p]
b1_010_0117,He works as the secretary to Hihaku Soaps'[r]chairwoman. I believe his name is [c4]Takumi Yumioka[c0].[l][p]
b1_010_0118,The Hihaku Soaps' headquarters and factories are[r]both located in Honjo, correct?[l][p]
b1_010_0119,Yes. They've been here for a while, but it's[r]only in the past ten years that the[r]company has shown significant growth.[l][p]
b1_010_0120,I remember seeing the chairwoman on the news a[r]few years back. She seems to be very shrewd.[l][p]
b1_010_0121,With the increase in sales, I assume she'd want[r]her factories running at full capacity.[l][p]
b1_010_0122,But with the harsh restrictions against industrial[r]waste, a lot of the factories with older equipment[r]had be to shut down.[l][p]
b1_010_0123,That's right. Even ten years ago there were[r]many complaints about chemical plants dumping[r]waste into the river.[l][p]
b1_010_0124,Most companies back then were more concerned[r]with making a profit than protecting the[r]environment.[l][p]
b1_010_0125,I wonder what a man working for such[r]a company would've been up to in the middle[r]of the night.[l][p]
b1_010_0126,On the way here I stopped by the company's[r]headquarters, but they hadn't started for the day.[r]I should have better luck later.[l][p]
b1_010_0127,Let's hope you will.[l][p]
b1_010_0128,Perhaps they're interested in seeing if the[r]rite would be beneficial for their[r]product research into beauty and skincare?[l][p]
b1_010_0129,Ha! Now that's an interesting thought![l][p]
b1_010_0130,I ran into one more suspicious young man last[r]night.[l][p]
b1_010_0131,This one seemed to be out collecting soul dregs,[r]right?[l][p]
b1_010_0132,Indeed. I couldn't get a good look at him[r]though, and I couldn't gather enough[r]intel to properly identify him.[l][p]
b1_010_0133,Well, that's a shame.[l][p]
b1_010_0134,But I can make an educated guess.[l][p]
b1_010_0135,Oh?[l][p]
b1_010_0136,You know that researcher who discovered the[r]ancient text on the Rite of Resurrection?[r]The one that lives near here?[l][p]
b1_010_0137,His name is [c4]Hideki Araishi[c0], and the man I met was[r]very similar in stature.[l][p]
b1_010_0138,Oh my, even he is involved? How awfully suspect.[l][p]
b1_010_0139,Considering his background, couldn't he be[r]the one who initiated the whole[r]affair?[l][p]
b1_010_0140,I think it's possible, yes.[l][p]
b1_010_0141,Which is why I decided to refrain from making[r]contact with him for the time being.[r]Safety first.[l][p]
b1_010_0142,Understandable.[l][p]
b1_010_0143,Of course, I want to learn more, but this isn't[r]the right time to focus on him.[l][p]
b1_010_0144,I prefer to ascertain who else is a curse[r]bearer. First, I'll return to Hihaku Soaps to see[r]that man in black.[l][p]
b1_010_0145,Their headquarters are down on South Warigesui[r]Street.[l][p]
b1_010_0146,In addition to the three victims[r]associated with the Honjo Serial Killings...[l][p]
b1_010_0147,There's Michiyo Shiraishi, who reportedly committed[r]suicide, and the police officer who died at the Former[r]Yasuda Gardens.[l][p]
b1_010_0148,If strange deaths continue occurring like so,[r]they're bound to inspire strange rumors.[l][p]
b1_010_0149,But those last two have nothing to do with the[r]Seven Mysteries, no?[l][p]
b1_010_0150,It's true, both occurred a week before[r]this accursed situation began.[l][p]
b1_010_0151,Still, it cannot be ruled out.[l][p]
b1_010_0152,It's possible that the mastermind was involved[r]even with those killings.
b1_010_0153,How?[l][p]
b1_010_0154,What if there were preliminary steps to awakening[r]the Seven Mysteries' curses?[l][p]
b1_010_0155,Can we really assume they're unrelated just[r]because the timing doesn't match up?[l][p]
b1_010_0156,Or rather, the police officer's death is so[r]baffling that it'd be easier if it were[r]connected to these curses.[l][p]
b1_010_0157,The victim wasn't the type to be caught[r]off-guard easily.[l][p]
b1_010_0158,You seem to know a lot about this.[l][p]
b1_010_0159,I suppose we weren't strangers. My[r]personal feelings might be wrapped up[r]in this one too.[l][p]
b1_010_0160,I see.[l][p]
b1_010_0161,If you were to investigate this matter more,[r]you might get a lead on the mastermind.[l][p]
b1_010_0162,You're right. If we wish to focus on the[r]mastermind's identity, this would be a fine[r]starting point.[l][p]
b1_010_0163,We might even discover more deaths related to[r]the curses on the way.[l][p]
b1_010_0164,We should pay attention to today's news.[l][p]
b1_010_0165,I learned something new about the criminal[r]involved with the kidnapping.[l][p]
b1_010_0166,It concerns the serial killings. There was a body[r]found at Komagata High School.[l][p]
b1_010_0167,The person was identified as a school teacher,[r]his name was Kohei Jonouchi.[l][p]
b1_010_0168,Mm...[l][p]
b1_010_0169,Do you think he was a curse bearer?[l][p]
b1_010_0170,Not sure. It's possible.[l][p]
b1_010_0171,But regardless, this means the two people[r]who knew the truth about the kidnapping[r]are both dead.[l][p]
b1_010_0172,Hmm... Just when we were getting somewhere.[l][p]
b1_010_0173,It isn't enough to make me give up, of course.[l][p]
b1_010_0174,Still, we don't know anything about Michiyo[r]Shiraishi's residence. It'd be wise[r]to pay it a visit.[l][p]
b1_010_0175,Understood.[l][p]
b1_010_0176,The town is beginning to wake up once more.[r]The clamor of society can be heard from beyond[r]the garden gates.[l][p]
b1_010_0177,Like any day, a cloud of pollution drifts out[r]from the industrial area.[l][p]
b1_010_0178,No one's in the mansion at the moment. The door[r]has been locked shut.[l][p]
b1_010_0179,The housekeeper has already left after[r]cleaning and preparing food.[l][p]
b1_010_0180,This is the old mansion where I was born and[r]raised.[l][p]
b1_010_0181,<i>We may be surrounded by curses and death,[r]but...[l][p]
b1_010_0182,<i>it matters little. My only concern is whether[r]I can see my child again.[l][p]
b1_010_0183,<i>Where should I go to begin my search?[l][p]
b1_010_0184,<i>Which places have stood out to me most so far?[l][p]
b1_010_0185,Well, that's all I have to report. Shall we[r]continue with our investigation?[l][p]
b1_010_0186,What do you want to do? If you still can't use[r]the curse stone, taking a walk should be a fine[r]place to start.[l][p]
b1_010_0187,Right. Let's go together. I want to see[r]what's going on for myself.[l][p]
b1_010_0188,In that case, I'll trust you to decide on where[r]we should go, ma'am.[l][p]
b1_010_0189,<align="center"><color=#ddd><cspace=-2px><font="TELOP">白石家付近[x0.3][r]<cspace=0px><font="MAIN">Near the Shiraishi Household
b1_010_0190,How did it go?[l][p]
b1_010_0191,I went to visit Michiyo Shiraishi's family home,[r]however...[l][p]
b1_010_0192,No one seemed to be there. I got no answer[r]at the door, and all the lights were out.[l][p]
b1_010_0193,It seems to have been empty for a while now.[r]There was a stack of newspapers out front.[l][p]
b1_010_0194,Hm...[l][p]
b1_010_0195,I doubt anyone's still living there.[l][p]
b1_010_0196,Think
b1_010_0197,It's a bit quieter over here. It is a residential[r]area after all.[l][p]
b1_010_0198,All these rundown row houses[r]really scream "working-class", don't they?[l][p]
b1_010_0199,I've never liked these messy and cluttered[r]backstreets. They give me the jitters every time.[l][p]
b1_010_0200,It's reassuring to have someone as strong and tall[r]as Richter accompanying me. He looks so unfazed.[l][p]
b1_010_0201,I suppose a detective is used to this kind of[r]thing, always investigating and chasing criminals.[r]I wouldn't be cut out for it.[l][p]
b1_010_0202,Social connections run deep in working-class[r]areas like this place, so I decided to[r]talk to the locals.[l][p]
b1_010_0203,I met a few nice old ladies who were kind[r]enough to give me the scoop.[l][p]
b1_010_0204,Turns out the Shiraishi's reputation really went[r]down the dumps this past year.[l][p]
b1_010_0205,Is that so?[l][p]
b1_010_0206,I'll give you the quick summary.[l][p]
b1_010_0207,They moved here about three years ago.[l][p]
b1_010_0208,Their previous residence was in a better part[r]of town.[l][p]
b1_010_0209,Michiyo's father died in a car accident, leaving[r]behind just the two of them.[l][p]
b1_010_0210,[c4]Michiyo[c0]'s mom—[c4]Toshiko[c0], now a single mother,[r]relocated here.[l][p]
b1_010_0211,At first, they got along with their neighbors,[r]many of which were in similar situations,[r]helping and being helped in turn.[l][p]
b1_010_0212,So far, so good. What happened?[l][p]
b1_010_0213,Well, as I said, their reputation began to go[r]downhill about a year ago.[l][p]
b1_010_0214,A man recognized as Toshiko's [c3]common-law[r]husband[c0] had moved into the household.[l][p]
b1_010_0215,His name was apparently [c4]Kankichiro Iwai[c0].[l][p]
b1_010_0216,Neighborhood gossip is something else.[r]Somehow everyone knew his name.[l][p]
b1_010_0217,So, what of this Iwai character?[l][p]
b1_010_0218,He was apparently a vulgar fellow with a criminal[r]record.[l][p]
b1_010_0219,He was prone to violent outbursts.[r]The neighbors often heard screams and shouting[r]coming from the home.[l][p]
b1_010_0220,The neighbors took particular notice of Toshiko's[r]screams pleading with him to not hit Michiyo.[l][p]
b1_010_0221,That's terrible.[l][p]
b1_010_0222,As if that wasn't unsettling enough, every night[r]the neighbors also began to hear an eerie chanting.[l][p]
b1_010_0223,Through this, the Shiraishis' standing in the[r]neighborhood plummeted rapidly.[l][p]
b1_010_0224,Toshiko was often seen covered in bruises[r]and wounds.[l][p]
b1_010_0225,She stopped responding to her neighbors. She[r]would just turn the other way when greeted.[l][p]
b1_010_0226,They kept their storm shutters closed even during[r]the day, and effectively shut themselves away[r]from the entire community.[l][p]
b1_010_0227,That sounds horrible. Why didn't the police[r]step in and do something?[l][p]
b1_010_0228,Unfortunately, under our current laws, the police[r]aren't allowed to get involved with domestic[r]disputes.[l][p]
b1_010_0229,That's awful.[l][p]
b1_010_0230,And then Michiyo reportedly killed herself.[l][p]
b1_010_0231,Things only got worse with Iwai, and[r]Toshiko was admitted to the hospital for[r]physical and mental abuse.[l][p]
b1_010_0232,Ever since, Iwai hasn't returned to[r]the home.[l][p]
b1_010_0233,Many locals expressed sympathy for Michiyo's[r]circumstances, but...[l][p]
b1_010_0234,just as many were fed up with the Shiraishis[r]entirely, and seemed relieved that things finally[r]quieted down again.[l][p]
b1_010_0235,It seems that they were still considered[r]outsiders even after three years[r]of living here.[l][p]
b1_010_0236,I don't understand it.[l][p]
b1_010_0237,Why would Toshiko have gotten involved with such[r]a brutish good-for-nothing in the first place?[l][p]
b1_010_0238,I've heard many stories where one partner's[r]personality does a complete turn after entering[r]a relationship.[l][p]
b1_010_0239,After her first husband's death, Toshiko's[r]financial situation had also taken a turn for[r]the worse.[l][p]
b1_010_0240,She was determined to send her daughter[r]to a good high school; it's possible she fell[r]victim to sweet promises.[l][p]
b1_010_0241,Life can be tough, I suppose.[l][p]
b1_010_0242,You don't seem moved by the story, ma'am.[r]That's fine. People have all kinds of stories.[l][p]
b1_010_0243,But the Shiraishis certainly hadn't lucked out[r]with theirs, bringing such a violent man into it.[l][p]
b1_010_0244,<i>I don't understand why no one's come to[r]this house, even after Michiyo committed suicide.[l][p]
b1_010_0245,<i>I wonder if this place is...okay.[l][p]
b1_010_0246,<i>The Shiraishis were dealt a tough hand.[r]I can't imagine what it was like.[l][p]
b1_010_0247,<i>Could it be the girl was forced[r]by her circumstances to take[r]part in the kidnapping?[l][p]
b1_010_0248,Hm...?[l][p]
b1_010_0249,Oh? So, you came here too.[l][p]
b1_010_0250,...?[l][p]
b1_010_0251,What is it?[l][p]
b1_010_0252,Ah...[l][p]
b1_010_0253,Could you repeat what you know[r]one more time for me, Richter?[l][p]
b1_010_0254,<align="center"><color=#ddd><cspace=-2px><font="TELOP">南割下水通り[x0.3][r]<cspace=0px><font="MAIN">South Warigesui Street
b1_010_0255,The Hihaku Soaps headquarters are on the other[r]side of South Warigesui Street.[l][p]
b1_010_0256,They were closed when I visited this[r]morning, but it appears things are up and running now.[l][p]
b1_010_0257,Hihaku Soaps Office Building
b1_010_0258,Back in the Edo period the canal known as South[r]Warigesui ran through this area. But it's been[r]turned into a major road.[l][p]
b1_010_0259,It's a bit away from Kinshicho Station or Ryogoku[r]Station, though it's still considered a[r]nice area.[l][p]
b1_010_0260,The stories of the Everburning Lantern and the[r]Foot-Washing Mansion both took place around here.[l][p]
b1_010_0261,One of the bodies discovered this morning was[r]found by this road as well.[l][p]
b1_010_0262,This is quite a lively area, huh?[l][p]
b1_010_0263,I suppose you could call it somewhat of a city[r]center.[l][p]
b1_010_0264,He tells me he barely slept last night and yet[r]he seems to be brimming with energy.[l][p]
b1_010_0265,Was I too that resilient at his age? Perhaps it's[r]what sets apart a detective from the rest?[l][p]
b1_010_0266,To think a small soap-making company could[r]grow so much in such a short time.[l][p]
b1_010_0267,They have factories and warehouses throughout[r]the area now.[l][p]
b1_010_0268,You can see why director and now[r]chairwoman [c4]Natsue Yamamori[c0] is called the Queen.[l][p]
b1_010_0269,You mentioned that Takumi works as her secretary?[l][p]
b1_010_0270,That's correct.[l][p]
b1_010_0271,Do you think it's possible he's acting[r]on her orders?[l][p]
b1_010_0272,That's exactly my thinking. A curse bearer with[r]both money and power could certainly look at[r]resurrection as their next prize.[l][p]
b1_010_0273,Negotiating with a person of that stature may[r]prove difficult.[l][p]
b1_010_0274,...[l][p]
b1_010_0275,Business is up and running. I can see people[r]inside the reception area.[l][p]
b1_010_0276,I'm going to go in. I may be a while, so feel[r]to find somewhere to kill time.[l][p]
b1_010_0277,Okay. Good luck in there.[l][p]
b1_010_0278,Sorry to keep you waiting.[l][p]
b1_010_0279,How did it go?[l][p]
b1_010_0280,I'll fast forward to the conclusion. I met with[r]Takumi.[l][p]
b1_010_0281,There's no doubt, he's the same man I saw[r]last night.[l][p]
b1_010_0282,But...it doesn't seem like he's a curse bearer.[l][p]
b1_010_0283,Mm...[l][p]
b1_010_0284,But that doesn't mean he has no connections[r]to the recent curses.[l][p]
b1_010_0285,He knew about the Seven Mysteries. He even[r]guessed we have a curse stone of our own.
b1_010_0286,Excuse me?[l][p]
b1_010_0287,I tried to approach Takumi about a fallen item[r]after I ran into him last night, however...
b1_010_0288,You said your name was...Richter, correct?[r]I have a favor I'd like to ask of you.[l][p]
b1_010_0289,I'm hoping you would hand over the curse stone[r]in your possession.[l][p]
b1_010_0290,Curse stone? What are you on about?[l][p]
b1_010_0291,There's no need to play dumb with me. In fact,[r]there's no time for it.[l][p]
b1_010_0292,I had all the same reason you did to[r]think you were a curse bearer last night.[l][p]
b1_010_0293,And your arrival here only confirms it.[r]You are a curse bearer, no?[l][p]
b1_010_0294,...[l][p]
b1_010_0295,You're right. We lack time.[l][p]
b1_010_0296,I'll confess. I am a curse bearer. I possess the[r]curse stone of the Haunting Clappers.[l][p]
b1_010_0297,I'm glad to hear the truth. Finally, this[r]conversation is worthwhile.[l][p]
b1_010_0298,It is a dangerous item you hold. Give it to me.[r]My company will take the responsibility to[r]dispose of it.[l][p]
b1_010_0299,I didn't know the soap business specialized[r]in scrubbing curses clean.[l][p]
b1_010_0300,It is the prerogative of Ms. Yamamori.[l][p]
b1_010_0301,Is that so?[l][p]
b1_010_0302,Assuming you've obtained the curse,[r]you understand the power it involves, no?[l][p]
b1_010_0303,Ms. Yamamori possesses [c3]supernatural powers[c0][r]akin to those of a god.[l][p]
b1_010_0304,She also has a deep love for this land, having[r]transformed it from the pile of dirt it once was[r]to the home of our headquarters.[l][p]
b1_010_0305,She cannot stomach the fact that it's now the[r]site of these curses run rampant.[l][p]
b1_010_0306,So, you're telling me the queen of Hihaku is a[r]real-life witch?[l][p]
b1_010_0307,She wouldn't appreciate being[r]called that, mind you.[l][p]
b1_010_0308,There's a sorcerer by the name of Suigen Gamyodo[r]who's gallantly working behind the scenes[r]exorcising spirits and the like.[l][p]
b1_010_0309,Go on.[l][p]
b1_010_0310,That being so, there have already been instances[r]of the dead coming back to life. Do you[r]understand the urgency of this matter?[l][p]
b1_010_0311,These are curses we're speaking of, tools which[r]are used by wicked beings to possess people.[l][p]
b1_010_0312,The Rite of Resurrection is nothing but a[r]fabrication meant to seduce the curse bearers[r]into unspeakable action.[l][p]
b1_010_0313,If you truly understand what I'm talking about,[r]you must hand over that curse stone at once.[l][p]
b1_010_0314,Very interesting.[l][p]
b1_010_0315,With that said, just how many curse stones have[r]you acquired so far?[l][p]
b1_010_0316,If what you tell me is true, surely the company[r]would have launched a large scale search by now.[l][p]
b1_010_0317,...[l][p]
b1_010_0318,We have six.[l][p]
b1_010_0319,Six! Whoa. I can rest at ease then.[l][p]
b1_010_0320,And here I thought I was at risk of being[r]cursed.[l][p]
b1_010_0321,It seems we are on the same page.[l][p]
b1_010_0322,If that is the case, you should hand over your[r]curse stone immediately.[l][p]
b1_010_0323,I'm sorry to disappoint you, but it's not[r]actually in my possession at the moment. Considering[r]its importance, I've been keeping it in hiding.[l][p]
b1_010_0324,Really now?[l][p]
b1_010_0325,Then I'll accompany you while you retrieve it.[l][p]
b1_010_0326,I'm sorry, but...I've got something important to[r]attend to. But I promise, I'll return with it[r]later.[l][p]
b1_010_0327,...[l][p]
b1_010_0328,Very well.[l][p]
b1_010_0329,Then you won't refuse to provide your address and[r]telephone number, I presume.[l][p]
b1_010_0330,How prudent of you. I'll oblige.[l][p]
b1_010_0331,And that's how it went.[l][p]
b1_010_0332,Mm...[l][p]
b1_010_0333,So, they aren't after the rite after all?[l][p]
b1_010_0334,I wouldn't be so quick to trust him.[l][p]
b1_010_0335,Oh?[l][p]
b1_010_0336,I believe we're dealing with a master in[r]deception. He may well have made up a story to[r]convince us to part ways with our stone.[l][p]
b1_010_0337,I think he was lying about having procured six[r]curse stones as well. Like, really? Six?[r]That's excessive.[l][p]
b1_010_0338,Well, now I feel gullible.[l][p]
b1_010_0339,The company is plotting something. I wonder[r]what they mean to do with the curse stones.[l][p]
b1_010_0340,He seemed rather desperate to get a hold of ours,[r]despite us not having collected any soul dregs.[l][p]
b1_010_0341,Perhaps the people at Hihaku are the masterminds[r]behind the curses being unleashed.[l][p]
b1_010_0342,Because the chairwoman's a witch?[l][p]
b1_010_0343,I wonder about that too.[l][p]
b1_010_0344,If she really were that powerful, would her[r]secretary have divulged that information so casually?[l][p]
b1_010_0345,Takumi was either making it up as he went or...[l][p]
b1_010_0346,Or...?[l][p]
b1_010_0347,...Or he's trying to spread a rumor.[l][p]
b1_010_0348,For what purpose would he do that?[l][p]
b1_010_0349,Recently, people have been caught up about the[r]occult more than ever before. If word spreads that[r]Hihaku's chairwoman has godlike powers...[l][p]
b1_010_0350,She could very well benefit socially and[r]politically from that mystique.[l][p]
b1_010_0351,Mm...[l][p]
b1_010_0352,That's...unsettling.[l][p]
b1_010_0353,We should avoid Hihaku for the time being.[r]It'll be a pain if I have to deal with Takumi again.[l][p]
b1_010_0354,First, I need to confirm whether Takumi is the[r]man I ran into last night.[l][p]
b1_010_0355,Then I'll be able to determine if he's a[r]curse bearer.[l][p]
b1_010_0356,It'll be better if I go inside the headquarters[r]alone.[l][p]
b1_010_0357,You should walk around, visit a cafe for some[r]tea, perhaps?[l][p]
b1_010_0358,By the way, there's one more thing of interest[r]I heard while in the company's reception lobby.[l][p]
b1_010_0359,And what's that?[l][p]
b1_010_0360,People were discussing whether one of the bodies[r]found this morning was that of a Hihaku employee.[l][p]
b1_010_0361,Really?[l][p]
b1_010_0362,So long as the officials haven't revealed[r]the identity, it all amounts to no more than[r]speculation though.[l][p]
b1_010_0363,Despite that, I've reason to believe Hihaku Soaps[r]is deeply involved with the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
b1_010_0364,At the very least, I can assure you I've gathered[r]that much.[l][p]
b1_010_0365,The more we know, the better our negotiations will[r]go.[l][p]
b1_010_0366,In the meantime, we should be off somewhere else.[r]There's no reason to stick around here any longer.[l][p]
b1_010_0367,<i>So an influential person at Hihaku Soaps[r]is potentially a curse bearer?[l][p]
b1_010_0368,<i>Richter proposed we use money to negotiate[r]for the curse stones.[l][p]
b1_010_0369,<i>But we could hardly outbid a large[r]corporation if it came down to it.[l][p]
b1_010_0370,<i>How interesting that the queen of[r]Hihaku—or the witch, whatever she is—is[r]trying to get her hands on the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
b1_010_0371,<i>It's like some kind of dark fairy tale.[l][p]
b1_010_0372,<i>Regardless of what is or isn't true, we must[r]stay one step ahead.[l][p]
b1_010_0373,<align="center"><color=#ddd><cspace=-4px><font="TELOP">駒形高校正門前[x0.3][r]<cspace=0px><font="MAIN">Komagata High School, Front Gates
b1_010_0374,Here we are at ground zero, Komagata High School.[l][p]
b1_010_0375,I guess it's logical that the police's got this[r]place shut down. The teacher's body[r]was found here after all.[l][p]
b1_010_0376,It's as if the students have nowhere to go now[r]that the school's closed.[l][p]
b1_010_0377,This is Komagata High School. I guess there[r]haven't been any developments.[l][p]
b1_010_0378,School Gates
b1_010_0379,The news has attracted a bunch of[r]curious onlookers, huh?[l][p]
b1_010_0380,That works in our favor. The more people around,[r]the better we can blend in.[l][p]
b1_010_0381,He appears to be wary of those police officers.[l][p]
b1_010_0382,Maybe the police really do have something against[r]private investigators, just like in those detective[r]novels...[l][p]
b1_010_0383,It seems the officers are still inspecting the[r]scene. Entry has been strictly prohibited.[l][p]
b1_010_0384,This place is said to be connected with the[r]story of the Fool's Procession.[l][p]
b1_010_0385,I wouldn't be surprised if a curse bearer decided[r]to turn up.[l][p]
b1_010_0386,However, I need to find out if that teacher was[r]a curse bearer or not.[l][p]
b1_010_0387,I expect the police to be baffled, since[r]they don't know about the curses.[l][p]
b1_010_0388,I can ask around and see what the students have[r]to say.
b1_010_0389,Inquire
b1_010_0390,Look elsewhere
b1_010_0391,The students are bound to know more about Michiyo.[l][p]
b1_010_0392,Well... If you change your mind, just let me know.[l][p]
b1_010_0393,All right. I'll go ask the students about Michiyo.[l][p]
b1_010_0394,I'm back, ma'am.[l][p]
b1_010_0395,So, what did you learn?[l][p]
b1_010_0396,That school kids sure love a good rumor.[l][p]
b1_010_0397,I was practically drowning in stories about[r]Mr. Jonouchi and Michiyo, most of which[r]seemed dubious at best.[l][p]
b1_010_0398,Not surprising.[l][p]
b1_010_0399,Most of what I heard was hardly worth[r]a second thought.[l][p]
b1_010_0400,But there was one story that caught[r]my attention.[l][p]
b1_010_0401,Oh?[l][p]
b1_010_0402,Some believe that Michiyo is the one who killed[r]Mr. Jonouchi.[l][p]
b1_010_0403,Really?[l][p]
b1_010_0404,The story's got two pieces of evidence[r]to back it up.[l][p]
b1_010_0405,One of them wasn't news to me.[l][p]
b1_010_0406,Apparently he's been mumbling that Michiyo[r]was going to kill him for some days now.[l][p]
b1_010_0407,A fellow teacher overheard his mumbling, and[r]told the students.[l][p]
b1_010_0408,And then it spread like wildfire, I suppose?[r]Rumors that juicy don't stay a secret[r]for long.[l][p]
b1_010_0409,As for the other piece of evidence...[l][p]
b1_010_0410,A [c3]pigtailed girl in her school uniform[c0] was[r]seen around school late last night.
b1_010_0411,Go on?[l][p]
b1_010_0412,Although numerous people claim to have seen the[r]girl, not one of them saw her face.[l][p]
b1_010_0413,Some are proposing it was Michiyo brought back to[r]life, or that it was her vengeful spirit.[l][p]
b1_010_0414,But it's not like Michiyo's the only high school[r]girl to wear pigtails. This rumor might've been[r]made up just to fan the flames.[l][p]
b1_010_0415,Hm...[l][p]
b1_010_0416,But if it were true...[l][p]
b1_010_0417,I'd want to get a hold of her in order to hear[r]her side of the kidnapping.[l][p]
b1_010_0418,If she's alive, that'd be ideal.[l][p]
b1_010_0419,There's still one more thing I should mention.[l][p]
b1_010_0420,I discovered where Michiyo lived. A student had[r]a list of student addresses on hand.[l][p]
b1_010_0421,That's an amazing find.[l][p]
b1_010_0422,I believe all of the students actually have a[r]copy of said list...[l][p]
b1_010_0423,It truly worries me how easy it was to obtain[r]what should be confidential information.[l][p]
b1_010_0424,Imagine what would happen if that information[r]got into the wrong hands.[l][p]
b1_010_0425,Well, so far it hasn't, no?[l][p]
b1_010_0426,Sure. Let's hope it stays that way.[l][p]
b1_010_0427,In the meantime, it's now possible for us to[r]visit [c4]Michiyo Shiraishi's house[c0].[l][p]
b1_010_0428,I can imagine the students are uneasy after[r]learning of the murder.[l][p]
b1_010_0429,It may do them well to stay home for some time,[r]if not for fear of their safety.[l][p]
b1_010_0430,The police are probably too wrapped up in solving[r]the case to be concerned about the students'[r]mental health.[l][p]
b1_010_0431,I can see that.[l][p]
b1_010_0432,It's important that society provides a safe[r]environment for the benefit of our youth.[l][p]
b1_010_0433,Some school policies could use some rewriting,[r]especially those handling the students' personal[r]information.[l][p]
b1_010_0434,That's right. I don't want a student being[r]kidnapped on their way back home ever again.[l][p]
b1_010_0435,I expect criminals to grow more cunning as time[r]passes. There may be times where the authorities[r]can't keep up.[l][p]
b1_010_0436,That's where outlaws such as myself[r]come in.[l][p]
b1_010_0437,What's this about?[l][p]
b1_010_0438,Ah... Actually...just forget I said anything.[l][p]
b1_010_0439,<i>Two people have died. A teacher named Kohei[r]Jonouchi, and a student, Michiyo Shiraishi.[l][p]
b1_010_0440,<i>Is there anything else to be gained here?[l][p]
b1_010_0441,<i>Michiyo's home...[l][p]
b1_010_0442,<i>I'd expect her family might be able to tell us[r]more but...it's a hard topic to bring up so soon[r]after her suicide.[l][p]
b1_010_0443,<i>However, it's normal for a high school girl[r]to keep things hidden from her parents, especially[r]if it involves criminal activity.[l][p]
b1_010_0444,<i>They're all dressed up for school.[r]In another world, I might've had the[r]chance to see my son in uniform too.[l][p]

b1_010_0447,Ayame Tono lives around here.[l][p]

b1_010_0453,That might be why Ayame chose to live here.[l][p]
b1_010_0454,It's always heartwarming to see children playing[r]in the park.[l][p]
b1_010_0455,Richter seems to like kids. Perhaps because[r]they're on the same wavelength?[l][p]
b1_010_0456,Ooh, good going, ma'am! You found High Coo![r]That's a rare one![r][l][p]
b1_010_0457,Is it now?[l][p]
b1_010_0458,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori07 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #7[c0] discovered!
b1_010_0459,We won't get much done standing around here.[l][p]
b1_010_0460,Why don't I go and check out Ayame's apartment?[l][p]
b1_010_0461,...[l][p]
b1_010_0462,You don't mean to speak with her, do you?[l][p]
b1_010_0463,No, I'd prefer to get an idea of what[r]she's been up to.[l][p]
b1_010_0464,I'd like to see whether she's been home or not,[r]just to potentially get a trace on her movements.[l][p]
b1_010_0465,Then...be my guest.[l][p]
b1_010_0466,Okay. I shouldn't be long.[l][p]
b1_010_0467,I'm back, ma'am.[l][p]
b1_010_0468,So...nothing?[l][p]
b1_010_0469,I'm afraid so. She still hasn't returned.[l][p]
b1_010_0470,However...[l][p]
b1_010_0471,However?[l][p]
b1_010_0472,I noticed a few people who seem to be related[r]to the police force keeping watch[r]in the area.[l][p]
b1_010_0473,I don't know if they got eyes on her apartment,[r]but they do appear to be watching the building[r]it's in.[l][p]
b1_010_0474,Interesting.[l][p]
b1_010_0475,You've got a sharp eye to have noticed[r]them despite them being so covert.[l][p]
b1_010_0476,What can I say. It's part of the job.[l][p]
b1_010_0477,However, it meant I had to refrain from[r]knocking on her door or looking through her[r]windows.[l][p]
b1_010_0478,I wasn't able to check her electric meter or[r]mailbox either, unfortunately.[l][p]
b1_010_0479,You were planning to go that far?[l][p]
b1_010_0480,We won't make much progress sticking around here.[l][p]
b1_010_0481,<i>It seems picking up Ayame's trail[r]is out of the question for now.[l][p]
b1_010_0482,<i>Why did we even come here?[l][p]
b1_010_0483,<i>What a waste of time. We should move on quickly.[l][p]
b1_020_0001,Start from beginning
b1_020_0002,Start from break-in
b1_020_0003,Start from searching Michiyo's house
b1_020_0004,Start from going outside

b1_020_0014,Ma'am, allow me to introduce one of our country's[r]most elite detectives.[l][p]
b1_020_0015,The name's Jun Erio. I'd hardly call myself elite,[r]but either way it's nice to meet you.[l][p]
b1_020_0016,This here is the brilliant Chief Inspector[r]Tsutsumi. And yes, he's just as rough[r]and tumble as he looks.[l][p]
b1_020_0017,Sometimes I really don't know if you're[r]complimenting or putting me down.[l][p]
b1_020_0018,So you two are detectives?[l][p]
b1_020_0019,This is my client, Mrs. Harue Shigima.[l][p]
b1_020_0020,Her father's a big deal in the police himself.[r]So remember to mind your manners.[l][p]
b1_020_0021,A big wig named Shigima...[r]B-Boss, you know of this guy?[l][p]
b1_020_0022,Shit, I've heard the name, but you know I don't[r]keep track of who's who in the upper echelons.[l][p]
b1_020_0023,There's no need to worry. I am my own person[r]after all, and my father has nothing to do[r]with any of this.[l][p]
b1_020_0024,Ooh, did you hear that, Boss? Looks like you're[r]getting off easy again this time![l][p]
b1_020_0025,Don't make it sound like I'm involved in some[r]shady business. It ain't like that.[l][p]
b1_020_0026,You both seem rather jovial despite being[r]detectives. How rare.[l][p]
b1_020_0027,All the police officers I've met have always been[r]so...dull.[l][p]
b1_020_0028,Well, you won't find any dull cops here. We'll[r]round up all your criminals with[r]a smile! That's our motto.[l][p]
b1_020_0029,How lovely. Keep it up.[l][p]
b1_020_0030,Just hold on one second. This is the[r]first I'm hearing of that.[l][p]
b1_020_0031,Well, you're right about them not being your[r]typical detectives.[l][p]
b1_020_0032,Talk
b1_020_0033,Jun Erio
b1_020_0034,Tetsuo Tsutsumi
b1_020_0035,Richter Kai
b1_020_0036,!
b1_020_0037,Think
b1_020_0038,I thought we might cause trouble standing[r]in the middle of the street talking like this,[r]but so far we haven't drawn attention.[l][p]
b1_020_0039,Then again, that might just be because nobody[r]wants to get involved with the case.[l][p]
b1_020_0040,It seems they were acquainted, but also[r]like they haven't talked in a long time.[l][p]
b1_020_0041,A young and energetic detective. He seems[r]to have a strong sense of justice.[l][p]
b1_020_0042,If my son had the chance to grow older[r]perhaps he would've become an officer[r]just like him.[l][p]
b1_020_0043,He seems like he's got a lot of experience[r]working the streets.[l][p]
b1_020_0044,Most of the officers I know are the bureaucratic[r]desk jockey types. The contrast is rather[r]striking.[l][p]
b1_020_0045,Damn, there was one here!? Lucky![r]That's #12, the Royal Kingpin Guin![l][p]
b1_020_0046,Oh? That so...?[l][p]
b1_020_0047,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori12 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #12[c0] discovered!
b1_020_0048,What brings you here, Richter?[r]You on a case?[l][p]
b1_020_0049,That's right. I'm picking up the police's slack.[l][p]
b1_020_0050,I trust you remember the kidnapping[r]and murder case from last year?[l][p]
b1_020_0051,Oh! I remember now! You're that[r]Harue Shigima! From the kidnapping case![l][p]
b1_020_0052,Huh? Did I miss something?[l][p]
b1_020_0053,Don't be an idiot! It was the case where[r]Munesada Shigima's grandson was kidnapped.[l][p]
b1_020_0054,Which must've been your son, ma'am?[l][p]
b1_020_0055,Indeed. The story was suppressed by the news.[r]In the end it was considered a huge failure on the[r]police department's part.[l][p]
b1_020_0056,Most of the investigation was conducted[r]in secret.[l][p]
b1_020_0057,And unfortunately the department is unwilling[r]to reopen the case.[l][p]
b1_020_0058,Any investigation carried out afterwards turned[r]up nothing at all, which is why I'm now[r]on the job.[l][p]
b1_020_0059,So they never caught the culprit, huh?[r]That's rough.[l][p]
b1_020_0060,So, your findings have brought you to this[r]place then?[l][p]
b1_020_0061,That's right. An individual connected to[r]the case used to live around here.[l][p]
b1_020_0062,"Used to"?[l][p]
b1_020_0063,That's right. As of last week they're deceased.[r]We'd hoped to talk to the family.[l][p]
b1_020_0064,No one was home when I checked last time, so[r]we figured we'd try again.[l][p]
b1_020_0065,Interesting.[l][p]
b1_020_0066,It sure doesn't look good on the police to be[r]mishandling cases like these.[l][p]
b1_020_0067,If there really was a culprit, it should be[r]our responsibility to bring them to justice.[l][p]
b1_020_0068,Well...I do consider the police my people.[l][p]
b1_020_0069,So, you consider the blame to be shared.[r]You've got a stern side as well, I see.[l][p]
b1_020_0070,Huh?[l][p]
b1_020_0071,By the way, that reminds me. Richter...[l][p]
b1_020_0072,Yes?[l][p]
b1_020_0073,You said the person who used to live here[r]died last week.[l][p]
b1_020_0074,You wouldn't be referring to Michiyo Shiraishi,[r]by chance?
b1_020_0075,You knew!?[l][p]
b1_020_0076,I thought so.[l][p]
b1_020_0077,It seems like we're here for the same[r]reason then.[l][p]
b1_020_0078,Seriously? Michiyo was involved with curses[r]and magic?[l][p]
b1_020_0079,Strictly speaking, the curse part isn't[r]our concern. We're looking into Yoshimi's[r]case.[l][p]
b1_020_0080,Yoshimi? Oh, right, Hajime Yoshimi's![l][p]
b1_020_0081,That's right. He died on the job. I'm sure[r]you've heard of it.[l][p]
b1_020_0082,I heard. It was a most unfortunate loss.[l][p]
b1_020_0083,So there's a connection between Hajime Yoshimi of the[r]Juvenile Division and Michiyo.[l][p]
b1_020_0084,Well, hold on. Let's focus on Michiyo for a[r]second. You think she had something to do with[r]the kidnapping?[l][p]
b1_020_0085,Hm... Talk about unforeseen developments.[l][p]
b1_020_0086,Exchanging information should prove mutually[r]beneficial.[l][p]
b1_020_0087,I'll tell you what I know, but in turn I want the[r]full scoop on your findings concerning Michiyo.[l][p]
b1_020_0088,Sure, to tell you the truth...[l][p]
b1_020_0089,What!?[l][p]
b1_020_0090,You believe Michiyo's ghost is the one who killed[r]Mr. Jonouchi!?[l][p]
b1_020_0091,So, he wasn't just mumbling nonsense!?[l][p]
b1_020_0092,I mean...we haven't fully confirmed anything yet.[l][p]
b1_020_0093,But the testimonies we've heard and the evidence[r]we've found point in that direction.[l][p]
b1_020_0094,Testimony? You mean from those, uh, psychic[r]high schoolers?[l][p]
b1_020_0095,Didn't they also say there was a chance[r]Michiyo hadn't killed herself?[l][p]
b1_020_0096,Wait! If that's all true then...![l][p]
b1_020_0097,Did you figure something out?[l][p]
b1_020_0098,Kankichiro Iwai![l][p]
b1_020_0099,Huh?[l][p]
b1_020_0100,Kankichiro Iwai! He'll be the next victim![l][p]
b1_020_0101,We have to open the door to the Shiraishi's house![r]We need to look inside![l][p]
b1_020_0102,Hey! What's gotten into you?[l][p]
b1_020_0103,Boss!?[l][p]
b1_020_0104,I'm sure the landlord would give us the key[r]if we asked.[l][p]
b1_020_0105,Screw that! You know how long that could take?[r]We can ask for permission later![l][p]
b1_020_0106,Richter...?[l][p]
b1_020_0107,Hey! Richter! Calm down! We can't just—[l][p]
b1_020_0108,I guess knowing how to deal with cops[r]is also part of an investigator's job.[l][p]
b1_020_0109,Not quite. The two of us used to be[r]comrades is all.[l][p]
b1_020_0110,Comrades?[l][p]
b1_020_0111,That's right. Richter used to be part of the[r]police force himself. He quit a few years ago[r]to go solo.[l][p]
b1_020_0112,Is that so?[l][p]
b1_020_0113,You should give it a try, Erio. There's more[r]freedom in working as a private investigator.[r]I can't say much for the quality of life though.[l][p]
b1_020_0114,It's been two years, right? I hadn't heard[r]of you since you quit.[l][p]
b1_020_0115,I didn't think your business would last,[r]but here you are.[l][p]
b1_020_0116,You sure you don't want to return to the force?[r]We'd take you back with open arms.[l][p]
b1_020_0117,What? To sit on my ass and watch the birds fly?[r]I'll take a pass. I don't belong in that world.[l][p]
b1_020_0118,Come on, Richter. We need your talent.[r]The public needs you.[l][p]
b1_020_0119,Nah, you don't. This is my calling. The police will[r]manage just fine without me.[l][p]
b1_020_0120,I'll keep on tying up all your loose ends.[r]Saving the lil' birdies you abandon.[l][p]
b1_020_0121,I can't believe you were actually[r]part of the police force once.[l][p]
b1_020_0122,There's a story behind everything, ma'am.[l][p]
b1_020_0123,I don't regret my time on the force.[r]I wouldn't have the connections I[r]have today without it.[l][p]
b1_020_0124,By the way, ma'am. This might be sudden,[r]but there's something I'd like to confirm[r]with you.[l][p]
b1_020_0125,And that is?[l][p]
b1_020_0126,Do you happen to know anything[r]about the Seven Mysteries of Honjo?[l][p]
b1_020_0127,...![l][p]
b1_020_0128,Sorry Chief, but that's hardly—[l][p]
b1_020_0129,With all due respect, investigator. I think[r]my question was addressed to the lady.[l][p]
b1_020_0130,Hmph. If you insist.[l][p]
b1_020_0131,What do you say, ma'am? Can you tell us anything?[l][p]
b1_020_0132,Umm...[l][p]
b1_020_0133,I don't know much.
b1_020_0134,...
b1_020_0135,I've heard of the Seven Mysteries,[r]but this talk of curses eludes me.[l][p]
b1_020_0136,...[l][p]
b1_020_0137,Can't say I know much...[l][p]
b1_020_0138,...[l][p]
b1_020_0139,Is that so. Well...I'm sorry for the[r]intrusion.[l][p]
b1_020_0140,Come to think of it. I heard some things[r]about this area last night...[l][p]
b1_020_0141,Something about a strange yet conspicuous[r]man dressed in white loitering around...[l][p]
b1_020_0142,Wait a second...[l][p]
b1_020_0143,I assume they were talking about you,[r]investigator.[l][p]
b1_020_0144,Well...I won't argue that I'm strange and[r]conspicuously dressed in white.[l][p]
b1_020_0145,And as it turns out, I was out here last[r]night to conduct my investigation.[l][p]
b1_020_0146,Did you run into anything strange or[r]out of the ordinary?[l][p]
b1_020_0147,Out of the ordinary... Hm...[l][p]
b1_020_0148,I guess I did observe a few suspicious[r]characters.[l][p]
b1_020_0149,You were asking about curses just now. Why would[r]a public servant be interested in the occult?[l][p]
b1_020_0150,Boss, Richter's a smart man. He can help us[r]if we tell him what we know.[l][p]
b1_020_0151,...[l][p]
b1_020_0152,I can't promise I'll be of any help to you.[r]But I'm interested in hearing what you[r]got to say.[l][p]
b1_020_0153,Something is happening in Honjo, isn't there?[r]It must be something big if they've[r]got you head office guys on it.[l][p]
b1_020_0154,Well...I guess it's all right. Desperate times[r]call for desperate measures.[l][p]
b1_020_0155,Thank you, Boss.[l][p]
b1_020_0156,Listen closely to what we're about to say, Richter.[l][p]
b1_020_0157,Huh. So by using curses to commit murders, these[r]people collect soul dregs to perform the[r]Rite of Resurrection?[l][p]
b1_020_0158,And these...curse stones are somehow connected[r]to the Seven Mysteries of Honjo?[l][p]
b1_020_0159,It's a tough story to swallow, but I don't[r]see a reason to doubt you either.[l][p]
b1_020_0160,We figured the strange occurrences happening[r]around here recently are connected to[r]these curses.[l][p]
b1_020_0161,To get this situation under control, we've been[r]searching for the curse bearers to[r]confiscate their curse stones.[l][p]
b1_020_0162,Do you have any information that might help us?[l][p]
b1_020_0163,That's tough, I never expected curses[r]and other mumbo jumbo to play into[r]this all...[l][p]
b1_020_0164,But if we're talking shady characters...[l][p]
b1_020_0165,There was this middle-aged fellow I saw on[r]South Warigesui Street. He had an[r]average build.[l][p]
b1_020_0166,He was anxious. Like he was searching[r]for prey.[l][p]
b1_020_0167,Boss, what do you think?[l][p]
b1_020_0168,Well, considering the location it could've been[r]Hideki Araishi.[l][p]
b1_020_0169,We already got his curse stone.[l][p]
b1_020_0170,Impressive! You two are working quick.[l][p]
b1_020_0171,Did you see anything else?[l][p]
b1_020_0172,Not that I can remember.[l][p]
b1_020_0173,That's a shame.[l][p]
b1_020_0174,If you see any characters who look like they[r]might be carrying a curse stone, it'd be a huge[r]help if you let us know.[l][p]
b1_020_0175,Absolutely. I'll let you know if I find anything.[l][p]
b1_020_0176,Richter, perhaps you could lend a hand[r]on our case too?[l][p]
b1_020_0177,There's a number of people we can't track,[r]and finding missing persons happens to be[r]your specialty, no?[l][p]
b1_020_0178,I hate to disappoint you, but I'm busy enough[r]with this case.[l][p]
b1_020_0179,The faith of my clients is what keeps me afloat.[r]I have to prioritize requests by the order in[r]which they come.[l][p]
b1_020_0180,I see. Well, can't say that's not fair.[l][p]
b1_020_0181,What do you need a private investigator for[r]anyway? The cops should have plenty of[r]bright folks to throw at the job.[l][p]
b1_020_0182,True, but...this isn't an ordinary case[r]we're dealing with here.[l][p]
b1_020_0183,<i>So these detectives are out here because[r]of the recent string of strange deaths.[l][p]
b1_020_0184,<i>It's best we keep quiet about our involvement[r]with the curses.[l][p]
b1_020_0185,<i>That was a close one though. I hope[r]they're not onto us.[l][p]
b1_020_0186,<i>Richter's amazing. He's coaxed out[r]so much information we didn't know about the[r]curse bearers from them.[l][p]
b1_020_0187,<i>There's no way we could cooperate with them[r]when we're trying to get our hands on the rite[r]ourselves.[l][p]
b1_020_0188,Take that, you shitty door! That's how you do it![l][p]
b1_020_0189,Richter! Get a hold of yourself![l][p]
b1_020_0190,I see you're still the same as always...[l][p]
b1_020_0191,Everyone! Come quick! Look at this![l][p]
b1_020_0192,Aaah![l][p]
b1_020_0193,Whoa! What's up with this room? Boss, there's a[r]dead body in here![l][p]
b1_020_0194,Whoa! Could that be Michiyo's dad?[l][p]
b1_020_0195,Nah, he's her stepdad at best, if that.[r]It's got to be the body of Kankichiro Iwai.[l][p]
b1_020_0196,There's no doubt about it. This man's a goner.[r]He's gotten real messed up.[l][p]
b1_020_0197,Looks like he's been like this for a while.[r]I'd say it happened last night.[l][p]
b1_020_0198,Erio. Did you find Jonouchi's body in the[r]same state?[l][p]
b1_020_0199,Now that you mention it![l][p]
b1_020_0200,It looked as though Kohei Jonouchi had died from[r]a number of heavy blows.[l][p]
b1_020_0201,What are you suggesting, investigator?[l][p]
b1_020_0202,It was Michiyo Shiraishi! She's alive![l][p]
b1_020_0203,She used the power of the curses to get[r]back at the men who ruined her life![l][p]
b1_020_0204,That's ridiculous![l][p]
b1_020_0205,You're suggesting she actually revived?[l][p]
b1_020_0206,It's got to be that! And if she's alive,[r]then...[l][p]
b1_020_0207,My apologies for interrupting, I know[r]we've just arrived at an interesting plot point.[l][p]
b1_020_0208,But do you really think a dead girl is[r]going around taking revenge from[r]beyond the grave?[l][p]
b1_020_0209,Consider this...what if Michiyo Shiraishi[r]never died?[l][p]
b1_020_0210,But seeing as you've come this far, I'm sure you[r]already know the truth, don't you?[l][p]
b1_020_0211,And so, I would have you answer me a question.[l][p]
b1_020_0212,Where in Honjo was Michiyo Shiraishi at the[r]hour of [c3]eight o'clock this morning[c0]?[l][p]
b1_020_0213,[s0][a1][x0.7]Where was Michiyo Shiraishi at eight o'clock this morning?
b1_020_0214,Komagata Bridge
b1_020_0215,Ryogoku Bridge
b1_020_0216,Former Yasuda Gardens
b1_020_0217,Ho'onji Bridge
b1_020_0218,Komagata High School
b1_020_0219,Shigima Residence

b1_020_0221,Midoricho Park
b1_020_0222,Candy Shop Sennoya
b1_020_0223,South Warigesui Street
b1_020_0224,Michiyo Shiraishi's House
b1_020_0225,Sumida River
b1_020_0226,Heheh. I see, very well.[l][p]
b1_020_0227,Congratulations. You are correct.[l][p]
b1_020_0228,As expected, you got it in one go.[l][p]
b1_020_0229,Well...the cause of death was such, was it[r]not? You must have noticed some time ago.[l][p]
b1_020_0230,You got it wrong [$302] time... Well, it's a trivial matter.[l][p]
b1_020_0231,It may have been easier to reach that conclusion[r]had you considered the cause of death.[l][p]
b1_020_0232,Heh. I see, I see. So that's what[r]you think.[l][p]
b1_020_0233,Let's take a moment to reconsider what[r]you know and choose again, shall we?[l][p]
b1_020_0234,Let's get back to the story then, shall we?[r]I've taken up enough of your time.[l][p]
b1_020_0235,What!? So you really think Michiyo Shiraishi is alive?[l][p]
b1_020_0236,Just think it through and it all becomes[r]obvious![l][p]
b1_020_0237,It tracks, but...[l][p]
b1_020_0238,Do you really think that girl could've[r]managed all of this?[l][p]
b1_020_0239,First of all, Erio. Go report this to HQ.[l][p]
b1_020_0240,Understood. I'll get on it right away.[l][p]
b1_020_0241,I'll start investigating this place.[r]It sure isn't lacking in stuff[r]that needs a looking at.[l][p]
b1_020_0242,There's a bunch of photos of the same person[r]pasted on the wall over there.[l][p]
b1_020_0243,Huh?[l][p]
b1_020_0244,Whoa now! Hold on! These photos...[l][p]
b1_020_0245,These are all of Fumichika Nejima! Gross.
b1_020_0246,Really? Come to think of it, he was in the[r]papers a lot back in the day.[l][p]
b1_020_0247,Oh! There's even more pasted up over here.[l][p]
b1_020_0248,These are all [c3]cutouts from newspapers and[r]magazines about the Nejima Murders[c0].[l][p]
b1_020_0249,I don't get it. Why the weirdo shrine?[l][p]
b1_020_0250,Let's keep looking around.[l][p]
b1_020_0251,With the window and storm shutter closed, no[r]light gets in here at all. It's pitch black...[l][p]
b1_020_0252,The neighbors mentioned they started to[r]keep the house shut like this not[r]long ago.[l][p]
b1_020_0253,This drawer is really old. Chief Inspector, do[r]you mind if I look inside?[l][p]
b1_020_0254,Huh?[l][p]
b1_020_0255,I mean, in normal cases only the police would be[r]allowed to touch things, right?[l][p]
b1_020_0256,Right. Erio isn't here, so let me take a[r]look at it.[l][p]
b1_020_0257,There's just clothes in here. Not much[r]variety either...can't say they were big[r]spenders.[l][p]
b1_020_0258,Well, I was hoping to find a kind of[r]talisman here, but...I guess we're[r]not so lucky.[l][p]
b1_020_0259,I see. Thank you anyway.[l][p]
b1_020_0260,Looks like there wasn't anything interesting[r]in the drawer.[l][p]
b1_020_0261,This sliding door leads to the kitchen.[r]It barely fits the frame.[l][p]
b1_020_0262,There's nothing around to confirm his identity.[r]But by the looks of him I'd say he's[r]Kankichiro Iwai.[l][p]
b1_020_0263,You've seen him before?[l][p]
b1_020_0264,I heard he had a criminal record, so I assumed[r]he wouldn't have held a respectable occupation.[l][p]
b1_020_0265,Is this...what a curse does to a person?[l][p]
b1_020_0266,Ma'am. It'd be better not to look so closely.[l][p]
b1_020_0267,...[l][p]
b1_020_0268,It's...amazing.[l][p]
b1_020_0269,...[l][p]
b1_020_0270,Cruel is what it is.[l][p]
b1_020_0271,Look at these. Pictures of Fumichika Nejima cut[r]out from newspapers and magazines.[l][p]
b1_020_0272,Whoever put these up was obsessed.[r]I wonder what their intent was.[l][p]
b1_020_0273,You think the Shiraishis are somehow connected[r]to Nejima's case?[l][p]
b1_020_0274,Perhaps they did this as to not forget a[r]grudge or something.[l][p]
b1_020_0275,It's crazy to think Nejima might be[r]involved in all this too.[l][p]
b1_020_0276,Hm? Do you think he might have anything to do[r]with the body here?[l][p]
b1_020_0277,Maybe. The man's already out on parole.[l][p]
b1_020_0278,He's a curse bearer with a curse stone now. He[r]announced that from sundown today he'll be going on[r]a killing spree.[l][p]
b1_020_0279,Oh dear![l][p]
b1_020_0280,There's an emergency search underway as we[r]speak, but no one's yet managed to get a hold[r]of the bastard.[l][p]
b1_020_0281,So he hasn't changed his ways.[r]That doesn't bode well.[l][p]
b1_020_0282,To tell you the truth, the lady here isn't[r]completely unconnected from the Nejima[r]Murders either.[l][p]
b1_020_0283,You don't say?[l][p]
b1_020_0284,That's right. We talked about it last night.[l][p]
b1_020_0285,Twenty years ago, I found the hand in Sumida River[r]that brought the incident to light.[l][p]
b1_020_0286,You don't say! You were the kid from back[r]then?[l][p]
b1_020_0287,You were really brave. You did a great deed.[l][p]
b1_020_0288,Were you the detective I spoke with?[r]I had no idea.[l][p]
b1_020_0289,So you two have met before. Fancy that.[l][p]
b1_020_0290,I've been worried that Fumichika Nejima might[r]bear resentment towards you, ma'am.[l][p]
b1_020_0291,Hm... You might be right.[l][p]
b1_020_0292,Unfortunately that asshole is quite the[r]resentful type.[l][p]
b1_020_0293,Oh dear...[l][p]
b1_020_0294,That asshole... I wonder who put the idea[r]into his head? And now he's got the[r]One-Sided Reed too.[l][p]
b1_020_0295,He's threatening to massacre the people of[r]Honjo at sundown.[l][p]
b1_020_0296,Seriously!?[l][p]
b1_020_0297,On top of that, he's been itching to get[r]revenge on me as well.[l][p]
b1_020_0298,Of all things, the man's gone and threatened[r]to kill my daughter.[l][p]
b1_020_0299,Damn, that's quite the threat.[l][p]
b1_020_0300,Certainly you can't afford to stay put here?[l][p]
b1_020_0301,The fucker wants to get us all antsy.[r]When I finally get to arresting him it'll be[r]with a cool head.[l][p]
b1_020_0302,Not gonna give him the pleasure, huh?[l][p]
b1_020_0303,Well...if Iwai and Fumichika Nejima have[r]anything to do with each other...[l][p]
b1_020_0304,Then this room might hold a clue[r]to Nejima's location.[l][p]
b1_020_0305,Let's hope so.[l][p]
b1_020_0306,The person who put all these photos up must[r]have been obsessed with Nejima.[l][p]
b1_020_0307,They might've had some relation to Nejima's[r]victims, or perhaps it was the opposite.[l][p]
b1_020_0308,The opposite?[l][p]
b1_020_0309,What if it wasn't loathing, but admiration?[l][p]
b1_020_0310,But then...[l][p]
b1_020_0311,It's the same man in every picture.[r]Is that Fumichika Nejima?[l][p]
b1_020_0312,Wow. This is quite the spectacle. I don't think[r]I'll ever manage to erase this from my mind.[l][p]
b1_020_0313,Don't worry, Richter. You're quite[r]the spectacle yourself.[l][p]
b1_020_0314,Do you mean to compare me with the likes of a[r]bizarre criminal?[l][p]
b1_020_0315,These aren't just cut from publications. They[r]even snapped a number of shots of their own.[l][p]
b1_020_0316,They must've admired him. Why else would they[r]have collected so many pictures?[l][p]
b1_020_0317,Whatever the case, it's certain they were[r]obsessed.[l][p]
b1_020_0318,There are old books scattered everywhere.[l][p]
b1_020_0319,I wonder what they're about. Many[r]of them are written in a foreign language.[l][p]
b1_020_0320,It'll be a pain to look through all of these.[r]Let's save them for later and continue to[r]look around.[l][p]
b1_020_0321,What do you say, Chief? Would you let me look[r]through it if I wore gloves?[l][p]
b1_020_0322,Well, it's not like I'm any help with foreign[r]languages. Go ahead.[l][p]
b1_020_0323,Thank you.[l][p]
b1_020_0324,Huh... This seems to be a book on Western[r]black magic.[l][p]
b1_020_0325,The same runes are written here, alongside[r]detailed descriptions of the procedures.[l][p]
b1_020_0326,I suppose you'd call these grimoires. It's all a[r]bunch of nonsense if you ask me, though.[l][p]
b1_020_0327,You think this Iwai guy was studying them?[r]Perhaps to perform some kind of ritual?[l][p]
b1_020_0328,There are a bunch of handwritten notes beside[r]the grimoires. Whoever it was, they were[r]serious about this.[l][p]
b1_020_0329,Iwai doesn't look the type to be into this stuff,[r]but...you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.[l][p]
b1_020_0330,But why would he be studying black magic?[l][p]
b1_020_0331,According to the materials, this here rune is for[r]the restoration of youth. Perhaps he was[r]trying to become young again.[l][p]
b1_020_0332,This over here seems to be black magic[r]related to resurrection.[l][p]
b1_020_0333,Each one of these spells requires a[r]human sacrifice. Talk about dangerous.[l][p]
b1_020_0334,Resurrection? Like the rite?[l][p]
b1_020_0335,I guess no matter what part of the world, people[r]will turn to the occult for similar reasons.[l][p]
b1_020_0336,Hm?[l][p]
b1_020_0337,What is it?[l][p]
b1_020_0338,This looks like a [c3]journal[c0].[r]It's probably Iwai's.
b1_020_0339,A journal?[l][p]
b1_020_0340,Mhm.[l][p]
b1_020_0341,His writing is surprisingly thorough.[l][p]
b1_020_0342,It's almost as if he was writing a report[r]for someone.
b1_020_0343,Oh wow. Now this is something.[l][p]
b1_020_0344,What is it? What did he write?[l][p]
b1_020_0345,This is quite the find. Let me give[r]you a summary.[l][p]
b1_020_0346,So, this Kankichiro Iwai fellow...[l][p]
b1_020_0347,He'd been searching for a spell to restore youth[r]for years.[l][p]
b1_020_0348,So he was into black magic from the start...?[l][p]
b1_020_0349,He believed if he could learn to successfully[r]perform the spell, he could then use[r]it to earn a fortune.[l][p]
b1_020_0350,To tell you the truth, it seems he was already[r]getting funded after he acquired[r]this grimoire.[l][p]
b1_020_0351,You don't say?[r]This is starting to sound kind of familiar.[l][p]
b1_020_0352,But first...let's find out how he got his hands[r]on this grimoire.[l][p]
b1_020_0353,It seems that Nejima told him where he could[r]obtain the book when they were both in prison.
b1_020_0354,What!?[l][p]
b1_020_0355,That's nearly too much of a coincidence.[l][p]
b1_020_0356,Likely not coincidence, it seems like Iwai took[r]an interest in the Nejima Murders after[r]it made the news.[l][p]
b1_020_0357,He [c3]admired him[c0] rather passionately.[l][p]
b1_020_0358,You might even say he worshiped the man.[l][p]
b1_020_0359,Worship!? Nejima, of all people!?[l][p]
b1_020_0360,This was a time when students were itching to[r]rebel. Anyone who did something to shake the[r]world was bound to gather admirers.[l][p]
b1_020_0361,Iwai had been collecting these photos ever[r]since that time.[l][p]
b1_020_0362,And since he just so happened to land in prison[r]at the same time as Nejima, he made sure to get[r]in contact.[l][p]
b1_020_0363,This is a lot.[l][p]
b1_020_0364,I mean...even having it all laid out like this...[l][p]
b1_020_0365,The thought of Nejima being involved with these[r]grimoires is staggering.[l][p]
b1_020_0366,I don't think we ever had anything pointing to[r]that. What's the connection?[l][p]
b1_020_0367,To be honest, it's a shock to me too.[l][p]
b1_020_0368,For years we've been scratching our heads over[r]the motives behind the Nejima Murders.[l][p]
b1_020_0369,Yup. It's been a mystery to us all from[r]the very start.[l][p]
b1_020_0370,Whoa now! Wait just one minute! Do you think...?[l][p]
b1_020_0371,No way!! Are you saying—?[l][p]
b1_020_0372,That's right. The murders might've been for a[r]ritual. He was attempting to perform black[r]magic.[l][p]
b1_020_0373,The instructions written down for the sacrificial[r]offering [c3]match up exactly[c0] with the acts carried[r]out by Nejima.[l][p]
b1_020_0374,You've gotta be kidding me![l][p]
b1_020_0375,So that sadistic crap he was doing was all for[r]black magic?[l][p]
b1_020_0376,That's what the evidence suggests.[l][p]
b1_020_0377,However, Nejima tried to do some type of[r]resurrection ritual, but Iwai had different[r]motives.[l][p]
b1_020_0378,Chief Inspector, you might think this is all[r]the stuff of fantasy, but...[l][p]
b1_020_0379,That doesn't refute that Nejima and Iwai were[r]both acting in earnest.[l][p]
b1_020_0380,This is batshit insane! You're telling me that[r]nutjob did this all for some hokeypokey[r]resurrection—[l][p]
b1_020_0381,Shit. Resurrection![l][p]
b1_020_0382,That means there must've been someone Nejima[r]wanted to bring back to life.[l][p]
b1_020_0383,...![l][p]
b1_020_0384,Damn... That's it![l][p]
b1_020_0385,That has to be it![l][p]
b1_020_0386,Fucking hell, it all makes sense now![l][p]
b1_020_0387,What? What is it?[l][p]
b1_020_0388,So, about the Nejima Murders...[l][p]
b1_020_0389,There's some...information that's been kept[r]from the public.[l][p]
b1_020_0390,Go on...[l][p]
b1_020_0391,When we broke into his house and arrested him...[l][p]
b1_020_0392,We also found...[c3]a baby[c0].[l][p]
b1_020_0393,A baby?[l][p]
b1_020_0394,It was a girl, looked to be about six months old,[r]but she was covered in filth. She looked so[r]weak and sickly.[l][p]
b1_020_0395,We called the medics right away. If we were a[r]second later I'm sure the girl would've died.[l][p]
b1_020_0396,So was Nejima the father?[l][p]
b1_020_0397,He told us he'd found her under a bridge.[l][p]
b1_020_0398,He found her? She was abandoned?[l][p]
b1_020_0399,I've heard of parents threatening to leave their[r]child under a bridge as a threat, but to think[r]it really happens...[l][p]
b1_020_0400,Ah... I suppose there are those cases with the[r]dead newborns found stuffed in coin lockers, so[r]it's not without precedent.[l][p]
b1_020_0401,Whatever the case, we never found out the truth.[l][p]
b1_020_0402,But there's one rumor from back then that I could[r]never get out of my mind.[l][p]
b1_020_0403,And it's starting to sound more likely now?[l][p]
b1_020_0404,Well, I'm sure this isn't the first time[r]you've heard of it. Many believe Nejima's guilty[r]of more crimes than what got him convicted.[l][p]
b1_020_0405,Back then a lot of girls went missing.[l][p]
b1_020_0406,Yeah... I remember all of that.[l][p]
b1_020_0407,Among the high school girls that might've been[r]murdered, or maybe I should say sacrificed...[l][p]
b1_020_0408,was a girl who was pregnant.[l][p]
b1_020_0409,Goodness...[l][p]
b1_020_0410,That's horrific.[l][p]
b1_020_0411,He killed her...[l][p]
b1_020_0412,and dismembered her body.[l][p]
b1_020_0413,And we thought...maybe the baby we found is what[r]he pulled out from inside of her.[l][p]
b1_020_0414,Don't misunderstand me, this is all speculation[r]on top of more speculation, hear?[l][p]
b1_020_0415,But I for one never believed that man would[r]just take in a baby he found under[r]a bridge.[l][p]
b1_020_0416,I'm feeling sick...[l][p]
b1_020_0417,Stay strong, ma'am. I know this is hard to hear.[l][p]
b1_020_0418,Like I said, don't take that to be the full truth.[r]We were running on speculation back then.[l][p]
b1_020_0419,Now that this whole resurrection magic[r]has come into play...[l][p]
b1_020_0420,we should consider the possibility it was his child.[l][p]
b1_020_0421,And that maybe he was trying to revive whoever[r]the mother might've been.[l][p]
b1_020_0422,It's just a theory. But my life would be a tad easier[r]if it were true.[l][p]
b1_020_0423,That's an interesting thought.[l][p]
b1_020_0424,If there's anyone Nejima would want to resurrect,[r]a deceased wife is as good a guess as any.[l][p]
b1_020_0425,The fact that he obtained a curse stone[r]suggests he has an interest in the[r]Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
b1_020_0426,Damn... You're right. And here I was thinking[r]that he was only after the curse's[r]power to massacre.[l][p]
b1_020_0427,...[l][p]
b1_020_0428,Um... Chief Inspector...[l][p]
b1_020_0429,Yeah?[l][p]
b1_020_0430,What happened to the child?[l][p]
b1_020_0431,Without a birth registration on file, best we[r]could do was find the girl some suitable[r]foster parents.[l][p]
b1_020_0432,It was decided to keep the circumstances secret for[r]the sake of the child's future.[l][p]
b1_020_0433,Well... I'm glad she was taken care of.[l][p]
b1_020_0434,Don't mean to derail the conversation, but[r]there's still more written in Iwai's journal.[l][p]
b1_020_0435,We know Iwai had managed to obtain the grimoire[r]thanks to the advice he got from his idol,[r]Nejima, while in prison.[l][p]
b1_020_0436,After conducting research and gathering more[r]information, he determined he had a chance to[r]get rich quick.[l][p]
b1_020_0437,Right, he thought he could make some money if he[r]could successfully use rejuvenation magic.[l][p]
b1_020_0438,Correct. Turns out someone him gave him the idea.[l][p]
b1_020_0439,And get this...[l][p]
b1_020_0440,It was the one and only queen and[r]chairwoman of Hihaku Soaps herself,[r][c3]Natsue Yamamori[c0].
b1_020_0441,Wait! The chairwoman of Hihaku Soaps!?[l][p]
b1_020_0442,So, that's where this leads...[l][p]
b1_020_0443,Here, let me read what he wrote:[l][p]
b1_020_0444,"The Queen of Hihaku has a strange fear of[r]growing old."[l][p]
b1_020_0445,"Her fear of death is even worse. If she does[r]die, she wishes to be revived. And she will spend[r]whatever it takes to preserve her beauty."[l][p]
b1_020_0446,"Magic, rituals, and rites; she'll use whatever[r]means necessary."[r]"Her tenacity is unbelievable."[l][p]
b1_020_0447,She was apparently investing money into[r]any research on resurrection,[r]the restoration of youth, and the like.[l][p]
b1_020_0448,Hm. So she would even throw her money[r]at the occult.[l][p]
b1_020_0449,The places greed will take you...[l][p]
b1_020_0450,Well then, that brings us to...[l][p]
b1_020_0451,Hideki Araishi. She presumably funded his[r]research into Rite of Resurrection as well.[l][p]
b1_020_0452,That's what it all points towards.[l][p]
b1_020_0453,I wouldn't be surprised if the Witch of Hihaku[r]pounced at the rumors of the[r]Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
b1_020_0454,It's starting to sound likely...[l][p]
b1_020_0455,It might also be why she's spreading the rumor[r]about having godly powers. It's a convenient[r]cover for if she becomes young again.[l][p]
b1_020_0456,Godly powers? What's that all about?[l][p]
b1_020_0457,Ah. You can ignore that.[l][p]
b1_020_0458,Either way, I think Iwai took the payments he was[r]getting for his research to seduce a family into taking[r]him in to keep a low profile.[l][p]
b1_020_0459,The Shiraishi family, Michiyo and her mother,[r]Toshiko, were just his unlucky marks.[l][p]
b1_020_0460,And this is where you get involved. Are[r]you feeling steady, ma'am?[l][p]
b1_020_0461,Huh?[l][p]
b1_020_0462,This has something to do with me?[l][p]
b1_020_0463,Are you saying that...?
b1_020_0464,What are you talking about?
b1_020_0465,No! You can't mean...![l][p]
b1_020_0466,You've realized then.[l][p]
b1_020_0467,Perhaps...[l][p]
b1_020_0468,Natsue Yamamori's
b1_020_0469,Toshiko Shiraishi's
b1_020_0470,Michiyo Shiraishi's
b1_020_0471,Kankichiro Iwai's
b1_020_0472,Fumichika Nejima's
b1_020_0473,child
b1_020_0474,magic
b1_020_0475,living sacrifice
b1_020_0476,was a child.
b1_020_0477,was magic.
b1_020_0478,was the sacrifice.
b1_020_0479,[%7] [%8] [%9]![l][p]
b1_020_0480,What? Ma'am, please calm down. That wasn't it.[l][p]
b1_020_0481,Oh?[l][p]
b1_020_0482,Was I mistaken?[l][p]
b1_020_0483,Then what did you mean?[l][p]
b1_020_0484,That's exactly it.[l][p]
b1_020_0485,Iwai moved in with the Shiraishis to practice[r]his magic.[l][p]
b1_020_0486,He needed a sacrifice to perform his[r]youth restoration spell, but...[l][p]
b1_020_0487,That meant extracting the life force from[r]someone young.[l][p]
b1_020_0488,Oh no! Of course! That...that awful man![l][p]
b1_020_0489,What are you talking about?[l][p]
b1_020_0490,Ma'am. Please calm down.[l][p]
b1_020_0491,Iwai moved in with the Shiraishis to practice[r]his magic.[l][p]
b1_020_0492,He needed a sacrifice to perform his[r]youth restoration spell, but...[l][p]
b1_020_0493,That meant extracting the life force from[r]someone young.
b1_020_0494,Ah...[l][p]
b1_020_0495,Aaah![l][p]
b1_020_0496,So, it was Iwai! This man—![l][p]
b1_020_0497,Iwai worshiped Nejima. So, he must've also[r]despised Nejima's detractors.[l][p]
b1_020_0498,Not to mention he was captured and sent to jail[r]once before. Surely, he had a bone[r]to pick with the police.[l][p]
b1_020_0499,So when he realized he had the chance to[r]both avenge Nejima, embarrass the police, and[r]acquire a living sacrifice at the same time?[l][p]
b1_020_0500,Fuck...[l][p]
b1_020_0501,You got it. Iwai kidnapped Harue Shigima's son[r]and managed to score three birds[r]with one stone![l][p]
b1_020_0502,Ah... Aaah... AAAAAAHHH...!!![l][p]
b1_020_0503,You're telling me then that...that horrid man...![r]He never had the intention of returning[r]my child![l][p]
b1_020_0504,Ah... Aaa...aaah...!!![l][p]
b1_020_0505,I thought there might've been a reason why[r]the kidnapper seemed to be mocking the police.[l][p]
b1_020_0506,He never wanted money. His aim was to humiliate[r]the force. It all makes sense![l][p]
b1_020_0507,He must have used Michiyo to lower your boy's[r]defenses and then kidnapped him on his way[r]back home.[l][p]
b1_020_0508,That man...! He... He took Shuichi![l][p]
b1_020_0509,Haah... Haah... Agh![l][p]
b1_020_0510,Ma'am! Please calm down. I understand, but[r]you must remember to breathe![l][p]
b1_020_0511,You don't understand![l][p]
b1_020_0512,You have absolutely no idea what I'm going through![l][p]
b1_020_0513,This isn't a joke![l][p]
b1_020_0514,I wouldn't expect the police to understand![r]You'll never understand![l][p]
b1_020_0515,Living sacrifices! What a stupid, stupid idea[r]from a stupid little man![l][p]
b1_020_0516,Okay, ma'am. Let's just take a moment to breathe.[r]Why don't we go get some fresh air?[l][p]
b1_020_0517,I can't believe this! This is—! This is...![r]Ughhh![l][p]
b1_020_0518,Chief, I think it's best we take our leave.[l][p]
b1_020_0519,But before we go, there's one more important[r]piece of information noted in his journal.[l][p]
b1_020_0520,Oh?[l][p]
b1_020_0521,Iwai got in contact with Nejima last year, after[r]Nejima was released on parole.[l][p]
b1_020_0522,He provided him with accommodation[r]and financial support.[l][p]
b1_020_0523,Is that so?[l][p]
b1_020_0524,He managed to find a [c3]hideout[c0] for[r]Nejima to stay in.
b1_020_0525,Damn it...[l][p]
b1_020_0526,If anything, rather than use his money to support[r]the Shiraishis, it seems most went to[r]Nejima instead.[l][p]
b1_020_0527,If Nejima's lurking around anywhere at the[r]moment, it's probably in that hideout.[l][p]
b1_020_0528,Did he write where it is?[l][p]
b1_020_0529,Unfortunately, no. Not that I can tell.[l][p]
b1_020_0530,But it seems Michiyo knew where it was.[l][p]
b1_020_0531,She never met with Nejima in person, but she was[r]made to go in and clean up among other[r]things.[l][p]
b1_020_0532,What good is that information?[r]The girl's already dead![l][p]
b1_020_0533,Wait, no! She's alive![l][p]
b1_020_0534,That's right. Michiyo Shiraishi is alive.[l][p]
b1_020_0535,If you can find her and get her to talk, you[r]can get her to spill the beans on[r]his hideout too.[l][p]
b1_020_0536,Investigator, I'm asking you...[l][p]
b1_020_0537,I should be going. The lady's not well.[l][p]
b1_020_0538,It's off-putting to look at...but I can't help[r]but wonder what in the world this is.[l][p]
b1_020_0539,They're [c3]magic runes[c0].[r]They're used in [c4]Western black magic rituals[c0].[l][p]
b1_020_0540,Most of the time they're useless [c3]imitations[c0],[r]though. I wouldn't get too excited about it.[l][p]
b1_020_0541,Oh my? Who knew the chief inspector[r]was such an expert on the occult?[l][p]
b1_020_0542,I just chanced upon that information.[l][p]
b1_020_0543,That girl with the spirit sense we mentioned,[r]she's pretty informed on the subject.[l][p]
b1_020_0544,Hmm...[l][p]
b1_020_0545,Someone was attempting to perform Western black[r]magic in this place. Pretty absurd if you ask me.[l][p]
b1_020_0546,Of course, the person in question was dead[r]serious about it all.[l][p]
b1_020_0547,It looks like the things spread around here have[r]been like this for a while now.[l][p]
b1_020_0548,This ritual—or whatever—was something he attempted[r]up to recently.[l][p]
b1_020_0549,Plenty of the neighbors mentioned having heard[r]strange mantra-like noises coming from here[r]during the night.[l][p]
b1_020_0550,You think Iwai was the one chanting?[l][p]
b1_020_0551,Hard to say. Could've been one of the[r]Shiraishis as well.[l][p]
b1_020_0552,If we look through these books in the back, we[r]might learn whatever it is they were trying to do.[l][p]
b1_020_0553,There're candles and stones with inscriptions placed[r]all over. Are these tools for some ritual?[l][p]
b1_020_0554,Hey, don't touch anything, you hear?[l][p]
b1_020_0555,Ah...that's right. Considering this a murder[r]scene, we ought to leave everything as it is.[l][p]
b1_020_0556,All of this can be used as evidence. If anyone[r]besides forensics toys with it, it'll cause[r]trouble down the road.[l][p]
b1_020_0557,<i>This place is disgusting. Did Michiyo Shiraishi[r]really live here?[l][p]
b1_020_0558,Are you feeling better now that we've gotten some[r]fresh air, ma'am?[l][p]
b1_020_0559,I'm...fine.[l][p]
b1_020_0560,Suddenly finding out who the kidnapper was[r]really made me lose my wits.[l][p]
b1_020_0561,We managed to solve the kidnapping case[r]by pure luck here.[l][p]
b1_020_0562,You're right... But Richter?[l][p]
b1_020_0563,I...[l][p]
b1_020_0564,I feel...grateful towards Michiyo.[l][p]
b1_020_0565,Because she killed the kidnapper?[l][p]
b1_020_0566,There's that too.[l][p]
b1_020_0567,But it's for something else.[l][p]
b1_020_0568,If Michiyo is the one killing all these people...[l][p]
b1_020_0569,Then she must have acquired quite a sizable[r]amount by now.[l][p]
b1_020_0570,Soul dregs, I mean.[l][p]
b1_020_0571,...![l][p]
b1_020_0572,Hey...Richter?[l][p]
b1_020_0573,Whether the kidnapper's dead...or alive...[l][p]
b1_020_0574,It doesn't mean a thing.[l][p]
b1_020_0575,Revenge won't bring my boy back.[l][p]
b1_020_0576,And if Nejima is planning to cause a massacre[r]to collect soul dregs, then...all the better.[l][p]
b1_020_0577,I won't give up on resurrection.[l][p]
b1_020_0578,So...I'm counting on you.[l][p]

b1_030_0017,In further news...[l][p]
b1_030_0018,Today the body of an adult male was discovered[r]in the residence of one Toshiko Shiraishi around noon.[l][p]
b1_030_0019,The man, identified as Kankichiro Iwai, is said[r]to have been in a relationship with Toshiko.[r]He was unemployed at his time of death.[l][p]
b1_030_0020,While further investigations are still underway,[r]it's suspected that his death is connected to[r]the recent serial killings in Honjo.[l][p]
b1_030_0021,Evidence on the scene may also implicate Mr. Iwai[r]in the unsolved child abduction and murder case[r]from last year.[l][p]
b1_030_0022,Well, ma'am...[l][p]
b1_030_0023,It seems like we've managed to settle one[r]part of the kidnapping case for now.[l][p]

b1_030_0042,The ticking of the clock gets on my nerves[r]sometimes.[l][p]
b1_030_0043,I don't have a reason to use the phone right now.[l][p]
b1_030_0044,A fax machine. It can send images to other[r]places along the telephone network.[l][p]
b1_030_0045,I rarely find a use for it.[l][p]
b1_030_0046,A fax machine.[l][p]
b1_030_0047,The number for our home is [c3]63*-****[c0].[l][p]
b1_030_0048,Ma'am. Is everything okay?[l][p]
b1_030_0049,I'm fine. There's just something I wanted to[r]check.[l][p]
b1_030_0050,Is that so?[l][p]
b1_030_0051,I was just thinking we rarely use the thing,[r]but then that mysterious message asking for help[r]came in. How odd...[l][p]
b1_030_0052,I've grown so used to seeing this scroll, I don't[r]really give it a second thought.[l][p]
b1_030_0053,I wonder what kind of music Richter is into.[r]I imagine he likes English songs.[l][p]
b1_030_0054,I've stopped watching the news.[l][p]
b1_030_0055,There's too much fluff. I wish they'd cut out the[r]pointless stories and just reported on[r]what's important.[l][p]
b1_030_0056,The lights.[l][p]
b1_030_0057,It's a little dim even during the day.[r]But I like it that way.[l][p]
b1_030_0058,I suppose I should offer him some tea, but[r]I don't really feel like it.[l][p]
b1_030_0059,He's always going at his own pace.[r]He's rather fascinating.[l][p]
b1_030_0060,No matter how much I look at the flowers,[r]they don't make me feel anything.[l][p]
b1_030_0061,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori01 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #1[c0] discovered!
b1_030_0062,About the kidnapping
b1_030_0063,About the remaining curse bearers
b1_030_0064,About Richter Kai
b1_030_0065,Judging by the official announcement, it seems[r]what Iwai wrote is likely true.[l][p]
b1_030_0066,With both the kidnapper and his young accomplice[r]dead, the police should be able to handle the[r]rest.[l][p]
b1_030_0067,Now that it's over...[l][p]
b1_030_0068,I can't help but think how pitiful it all is.[l][p]
b1_030_0069,We never would've known a thing had we not[r]found his journal.[l][p]
b1_030_0070,Carelessness is what usually leads to crimes[r]like these being exposed.[l][p]
b1_030_0071,It was pretty much the same with the Nejima[r]Murders.[l][p]
b1_030_0072,But stumbling across the answer by pure chance[r]really makes you think.[l][p]
b1_030_0073,It makes my skin crawl to think of how[r]many cases like this are left undiscovered.[l][p]
b1_030_0074,Me too...[l][p]
b1_030_0075,It's certainly disturbing.[l][p]
b1_030_0076,Well, with the kidnapping case all wrapped up,[r]we can focus our efforts on obtaining[r]the Rite of Resurrection, yes?[l][p]
b1_030_0077,Indeed.[l][p]
b1_030_0078,I'm counting on you.[l][p]
b1_030_0079,All right. Let's reassess this curse situation.[l][p]
b1_030_0080,Right.[l][p]
b1_030_0081,I must admit, I never expected the police to be[r]so on top of things.[l][p]
b1_030_0082,The chief inspector, Tetsuo Tsutsumi, provided[r]us a good wealth of information.[l][p]
b1_030_0083,I'm surprised he knew so much about the[r]curse bearers.[l][p]
b1_030_0084,Do you think they noticed I'm one of them?[l][p]
b1_030_0085,I'm pretty sure Erio didn't. The chief inspector,[r]on the other hand... We'll have to be careful[r]around him.[l][p]
b1_030_0086,But if he had suspected anything I'm sure he[r]would've detained us. We should stay[r]vigilant moving forward.[l][p]
b1_030_0087,Agreed.[l][p]
b1_030_0088,Even if we steal a curse stone, you may not be[r]able to successfully perform the rite unless[r]you're a curse bearer yourself.[l][p]
b1_030_0089,Would you be okay with hanging onto the[r]stone from now on?[l][p]
b1_030_0090,Of course.[l][p]
b1_030_0091,Just don't use it though, okay?[l][p]
b1_030_0092,...[l][p]
b1_030_0093,All right.[l][p]
b1_030_0094,If what we've heard is true, there are just[r]three curse bearers left to be discovered.[l][p]
b1_030_0095,There's the Whispering Canal, the Beckoning[r]Light, and the Taiko of Tsugaru left to[r]investigate.[l][p]
b1_030_0096,It may benefit us to visit the places[r]connected to these stories a few times.[l][p]
b1_030_0097,I see...[l][p]
b1_030_0098,I'm still highly suspicious of the people at[r]Hihaku Soaps. They could be the ones pulling the[r]strings.[l][p]
b1_030_0099,That Takumi Yumioka fella is probably aware of the[r]curse bearers we're searching for.[l][p]
b1_030_0100,Tracking his movements may prove to be useful...[l][p]
b1_030_0101,You want to follow him?[l][p]
b1_030_0102,If we were to follow anyone, he'd be my first[r]choice, but...[l][p]
b1_030_0103,Damn it. Times like this really have me wishing[r]I had more personnel.[l][p]
b1_030_0104,I imagine it's tough working on your own.[l][p]
b1_030_0105,It's the plight of running a small business. I'm[r]always on the hunt for a skilled assistant.[l][p]
b1_030_0106,And then there's Nejima, who appears to be a[r]curse bearer too. The One-Sided Reed,[r]I think it was.[l][p]
b1_030_0107,If we want to look for someone that's likely[r]to gather a whole lot of soul dregs...[r]Well, look no further.[l][p]
b1_030_0108,He did say he would unleash his curse on a[r]large number of people at nightfall.[l][p]
b1_030_0109,If he gets the chance to. If the chief inspector[r]manages to track down Michiyo, then, well...[l][p]
b1_030_0110,There's a chance he'll manage to apprehend[r]Nejima before he gets up to no good.[l][p]
b1_030_0111,But why did you tell the chief inspector about[r]the safe house? If he hadn't had that lead...[l][p]
b1_030_0112,It was written in Iwai's memoirs. It was just a[r]matter of time till he found out.[l][p]
b1_030_0113,Besides, we're talking about a massacre here.[r]I can't just turn a blind eye.[l][p]
b1_030_0114,How different is it from any other curse bearer[r]collecting soul dregs?[l][p]
b1_030_0115,...Well, if we're talking Nejima it could be a[r]lot more dangerous. We'll just keep[r]a close eye on Nejima and the cops.[l][p]
b1_030_0116,...[l][p]
b1_030_0117,What about that girl from before? Ayame Tono?[l][p]
b1_030_0118,Do you think she could be a curse bearer?[l][p]
b1_030_0119,Well, there's a chance she could have[r]gone and stolen someone else's curse stone[r]by now.[l][p]
b1_030_0120,That's possible too, but...[l][p]
b1_030_0121,Hm?[l][p]
b1_030_0122,We haven't been to Midoricho Park yet, the[r]place connected to the Taiko of Tsugaru.[l][p]
b1_030_0123,Ah, right. That's close to where she lives.[l][p]
b1_030_0124,What if she was a curse bearer this[r]entire time? She could've lied.[l][p]
b1_030_0125,It's possible.[l][p]
b1_030_0126,It would make her a brilliant actress to boot.[r]The idea's got me itching to investigate[r]her again.[l][p]
b1_030_0127,That place is rather suspicious... If only we could[r]run into someone there.[l][p]
b1_030_0128,Richter?[l][p]
b1_030_0129,Yes?[l][p]
b1_030_0130,Um...[l][p]
b1_030_0131,Ah... That's right.[l][p]
b1_030_0132,Would you mind if we make a stop on our[r]way? We can make it quick.[l][p]
b1_030_0133,I apologize for the diversion, but I'd like[r]to visit a [c3]candy store[c0] if possible.[l][p]
b1_030_0134,...?[l][p]
b1_030_0135,Um, I suppose I don't mind.[l][p]
b1_030_0136,...[l][p]
b1_030_0137,Then shall we depart?[l][p]
b1_030_0138,From this part on, you will be given the option to [c4]Finish Investigation[c0] which will allow you to immediately end this part.[r][r]From there you can continue on to the next part.[r]You may also come back and restart this section from the point which you left off.
b1_030_0139,Ma'am. It's important we don't rush things. Let[r]us speak a little longer first.[l][p]
b1_030_0140,Oh? The phone's...[l][p]
b1_030_0141,Be my guest. You wouldn't want to keep them[r]waiting.[l][p]
b1_030_0142,Thank you. I shouldn't be long.[l][p]
b1_030_0143,Hello, Shigima residence.[l][p]
b1_030_0144,Oh. It wasn't the phone...[l][p]
b1_030_0145,What's wrong?[l][p]
b1_030_0146,Ah, nothing. It was just the fax machine.[r]I'm still not quite used to it.[l][p]
b1_030_0147,Oh! This is a fax machine? Amazing![r]So this is how they look![l][p]
b1_030_0148,This is incredible! Goodbye to snail mail, am[r]I right? This is the future![l][p]
b1_030_0149,I didn't think it would excite you so much.[l][p]
b1_030_0150,Oh oh! Something came out! Is it finished?[r]I could watch this thing all day![l][p]
b1_030_0151,Huh?[l][p]
b1_030_0152,What is this? It looks like it was written in[r]pen, but...[l][p]
b1_030_0153,What's it say? What's it say?[l][p]
b1_030_0154,Umm...[l][p]
b1_030_0155,It says, [c3]"Help! I'm trapped in a Hihaku Soaps[r]warehouse or factory near Ho'onji Bridge."[c0]
b1_030_0156,Huh? Hihaku!?[l][p]
b1_030_0157,Why would somebody send me such[r]a message? Am I being pranked?[l][p]
b1_030_0158,No... This is too fishy to be a coincidence.[l][p]
b1_030_0159,I wouldn't put it past Hihaku to have someone[r]locked up if it's got anything to do with[r]procuring the rite.[l][p]
b1_030_0160,We should check it out. Hopefully, we don't find[r]anything so sinister.[l][p]

b1_030_0162,???
b1_030_0163,Factory
b1_030_0164,Surroundings
b1_030_0165,Think
b1_030_0166,Did something draw your interest?[l][p]
b1_030_0167,No worries here. I made sure to take a[r]quick shower this morning.[l][p]
b1_030_0168,I was out here last night looking for the curse[r]bearer connected with the Beckoning Light too.[l][p]
b1_030_0169,Did you see anything?[l][p]
b1_030_0170,Afraid not. But they gotta be out here somewhere.[l][p]
b1_030_0171,What you saw earlier must've been the[r]Beckoning Light.[l][p]
b1_030_0172,Something might've [c3]changed[c0] after what just[r]happened.[l][p]
b1_030_0173,Richter?[l][p]
b1_030_0174,What do you think that is?[l][p]
b1_030_0175,Oh?[l][p]
b1_030_0176,Umm?[l][p]
b1_030_0177,I don't see anything.[l][p]
b1_030_0178,Really? You don't see...that?[l][p]
b1_030_0179,That thing that looks like a phantom ball of flame[r]floating in the air?[l][p]
b1_030_0180,A ball of flame?[l][p]
b1_030_0181,It must be the curse echo! Maybe only the curse[r]bearers are capable of seeing it.
b1_030_0182,But could such a thing happen in broad daylight?[l][p]
b1_030_0183,Ah...[l][p]
b1_030_0184,It's gone.[l][p]
b1_030_0185,Hmm...[l][p]
b1_030_0186,I wonder if that was the Beckoning Light's[r]curse echo?[l][p]
b1_030_0187,That phantom flame you saw might've been a[r]manifestation of the lantern.[l][p]
b1_030_0188,In that case...[l][p]
b1_030_0189,Does that mean a curse bearer is nearby?[l][p]
b1_030_0190,Hm... It doesn't seem like anyone's been here[r]for some time.[l][p]
b1_030_0191,I wonder if it's one of the factories that got[r]shut down when they tightened up regulations.[l][p]
b1_030_0192,After looking around, I determined the abandoned[r]factory is indeed Hihaku's.[l][p]
b1_030_0193,An abandoned factory near the Ho'onji Bridge,[r]everything lines up.[l][p]
b1_030_0194,So, the person who faxed us for help is in there?[l][p]
b1_030_0195,Let's find out. If there's nothing, we should[r]wrap up fast.[l][p]
b1_030_0196,Um, but isn't this place locked?[l][p]
b1_030_0197,Don't underestimate me, ma'am. I can make short[r]work of a simple little lock like this.[l][p]
b1_030_0198,Oh my, you truly are something else. Please be[r]careful then.[l][p]
b1_030_0199,There're so many old factories alongside this river.[r]It must've been quite different in its glory days.[l][p]
b1_030_0200,But now most of them are closed down due to the[r]tightened regulations on waste disposal.[l][p]
b1_030_0201,A curse bearer might be lurking in the vicinity.[r]I'm going to check the surroundings.[l][p]
b1_030_0202,Ah...[l][p]
b1_030_0203,Haah... Haah...[l][p]
b1_030_0204,Nothing. I didn't find anyone who looked[r]the part.[l][p]
b1_030_0205,I see...[l][p]
b1_030_0206,I don't doubt something happened around[r]here but...[l][p]
b1_030_0207,Something might've [c3]changed[c0] in the area.[r]Keep your eyes peeled.[l][p]
b1_030_0208,What's going on? There isn't a curse[r]bearer in sight.[l][p]
b1_030_0209,<i>Someone must've received the Beckoning[r]Light's curse here last night.[l][p]
b1_030_0210,<i>And if what I saw was the curse echo of the[r]Beckoning Light, wouldn't that mean the curse[r]bearer is nearby?[l][p]
b1_030_0211,<i>I'm not feeling any strange presence, but[r]that could be because it's midday.[l][p]

b1_030_0213,Telephone Booth
b1_030_0214,Playground
b1_030_0215,A bunch of kids gathered around Richter to[r]poke fun at his clothing.[l][p]
b1_030_0216,It seems like kids come running for him[r]wherever we go. Not all too surprising[r]with his attire.[l][p]
b1_030_0217,He hasn't complained about it though. I wonder if[r]he's got a soft spot for kids?[l][p]
b1_030_0218,This place is associated with the Whispering[r]Canal.[l][p]
b1_030_0219,The canal must be connected to the man who[r]was found drowned in the park.[l][p]
b1_030_0220,Agreed.[l][p]
b1_030_0221,Wasn't the victim a Hihaku Soaps employee?[l][p]
b1_030_0222,That's right. His name was Shogo Okiie.[l][p]
b1_030_0223,Considering his occupation, he probably came[r]here in search of a curse stone.[l][p]
b1_030_0224,If people in the company know about the rite,[r]it only makes sense they'd be looking for[r]curse stones.[l][p]
b1_030_0225,You think the chairwoman and Takumi would send[r]their regular employees out to hunt for the stones?[l][p]
b1_030_0226,If that's the case, perhaps that Shogo died[r]trying to take a stone from someone else?[l][p]
b1_030_0227,Either that, or...[l][p]
b1_030_0228,He was killed precisely because he was a curse[r]bearer with a curse stone.[l][p]
b1_030_0229,I suppose so, but...[l][p]
b1_030_0230,Considering the location, wouldn't that mean[r]the curse used was the Whispering Canal?[l][p]
b1_030_0231,Good point. That would mean Shogo Okiie wasn't the[r]wielder of the Whispering Canal curse himself.[l][p]
b1_030_0232,Could he have had the Beckoning Light,[r]or even the Taiko of Tsugaru?[l][p]
b1_030_0233,I was here last night, and there weren't any dead[r]bodies then. It's highly possible he was[r]brought here from somewhere else.[l][p]
b1_030_0234,If that's the case, the wielder of the Whispering[r]Canal has already collected his stone.[l][p]
b1_030_0235,Ah, ma'am? Excuse me, but there's one more[r]thing I'd like to try.[l][p]
b1_030_0236,Oh? Be my guest.[l][p]
b1_030_0237,Shogo Okiie is the name of the person who[r]died here.[l][p]
b1_030_0238,It's hard to believe he was here by chance,[r]only to end up murdered with a curse.[l][p]
b1_030_0239,Given his ties to Hihaku, we can assume he was[r]aware of the situation and somehow involved with[r]these curses.[l][p]
b1_030_0240,The area was closed off to the public this[r]morning after his body was found, but...[l][p]
b1_030_0241,The police quickly managed to complete their[r]investigation, and reopened the park as if nothing[r]ever happened.[l][p]
b1_030_0242,The people in the area are shockingly calm,[r]considering what happened here.[l][p]
b1_030_0243,You'd think they'd be put off knowing there was a[r]dead body here just this morning.[l][p]
b1_030_0244,From what I heard, it happened right about[r]where you're standing now.[l][p]
b1_030_0245,Eek![l][p]
b1_030_0246,Would you look at that? That's a pretty[r]unique looking playground.[l][p]
b1_030_0247,Did it catch your eye?[l][p]
b1_030_0248,Perhaps... Now's not the time though.[l][p]
b1_030_0249,But it did get you interested...[l][p]
b1_030_0250,<i>Does he want to...play on it?[l][p]
b1_030_0251,They made it quite the challenge. To pass through[r]it, you'd have to go underneath there...[l][p]
b1_030_0252,<i>He definitely wants to play on it.[l][p]
b1_030_0253,You can go take a look if you're that interested.[l][p]
b1_030_0254,Hm... All right. I'll go check it out just to[r]make sure.[l][p]
b1_030_0255,He didn't have to think long about that.[l][p]
b1_030_0256,...Hm?[l][p]
b1_030_0257,What's that? Did he find something?[l][p]
b1_030_0258,I found a Mocking Bird under the playground[r]equipment! Damn, talk about lucky! It's #19[r]Penny Prattle![l][p]
b1_030_0259,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori19 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #19[c0] discovered!
b1_030_0260,I see... Congrats.[l][p]
b1_030_0261,Playgrounds always get me all fired up.[l][p]
b1_030_0262,And I found some nice treasure to boot this[r]time![l][p]
b1_030_0263,I'm happy for you...[l][p]
b1_030_0264,A telephone booth. It doesn't look out of[r]the ordinary to me.[l][p]
b1_030_0265,<i>It's so peaceful here, it's hard to imagine[r]this place has anything to do with[r]curses at all.[l][p]
b1_030_0266,<i>Did two curse bearers battle it out here[r]last night?[l][p]
b1_030_0267,<i>Who could the other person have been?[l][p]

b1_030_0269,Woman
b1_030_0270,Richter seemed to be a little nervous when[r]Ayame Tono was mentioned. Or was I just[r]imagining it?[l][p]
b1_030_0271,Hey, that lady over there...[l][p]
b1_030_0272,That's Ayame Tono!
b1_030_0273,...![l][p]
b1_030_0274,She seems to be trying to hide.
b1_030_0275,Call out
b1_030_0276,Watch in silence
b1_030_0277,It doesn't look like she's planning to move[r]anytime soon.
b1_030_0278,We don't want to startle her and have her run off[r]on us. Let's sit and watch her for now.[l][p]
b1_030_0279,All right. I'll be right back![l][p]
b1_030_0280,Ah... He's gone.[l][p]
b1_030_0281,I suppose he really wanted to talk with her.[l][p]
b1_030_0282,Oh! There he is![l][p]
b1_030_0283,Does he mean to jump out and surprise her[r]from behind?[l][p]
b1_030_0284,Huh...[l][p]
b1_030_0285,Does he mean to intimidate her?[l][p]
b1_030_0286,Ah... She noticed! I guess his purpose was to[r]talk with her after all.[l][p]
b1_030_0287,I wonder what they're talking about. She[r]doesn't look like she's planning to run.[l][p]
b1_030_0288,Oh... They're coming here.[l][p]
b1_030_0289,Here she is! What do you think? Smooth work[r]by the master, hm?[l][p]
b1_030_0290,Yes... Very smooth.[l][p]
b1_030_0291,Hello. Thank you so much for yesterday.[l][p]
b1_030_0292,I know this is sudden, but...I'm actually[r]being pursued right now.[l][p]
b1_030_0293,Pursued? By who?[l][p]
b1_030_0294,I think it's the police. Would you be willing[r]to provide me shelter?[l][p]
b1_030_0295,From the police?[l][p]
b1_030_0296,I figured we could hear her out and see what[r]kind of mess she's gotten herself in.[l][p]
b1_030_0297,Don't make it sound like I'm some kind[r]of criminal, please.[l][p]
b1_030_0298,Why she's being chased
b1_030_0299,About the Rite of Resurrection
b1_030_0300,The police have my apartment staked out,[r]so I haven't been able to return home.[l][p]
b1_030_0301,I heard them say something about wanting to[r]protect me, but something didn't feel right and[r]I got scared.[l][p]
b1_030_0302,Do you have any idea why they're after you?[l][p]
b1_030_0303,Well, I have been searching for the curses, so...[l][p]
b1_030_0304,We shouldn't trouble ourselves with hiding you[r]if they're after you for a good reason.[l][p]
b1_030_0305,Huh!? How cruel![l][p]
b1_030_0306,But this handsome investigator wouldn't turn me[r]in so easily, would you?[l][p]
b1_030_0307,It's unfortunate, but...we've got reason not to[r]get involved with the police ourselves.[l][p]
b1_030_0308,What shady reasoning![l][p]
b1_030_0309,But if you've got some murky secret to hide, we[r]might as well cooperate with each other, no?[l][p]
b1_030_0310,What if we make a deal? In exchange for keeping[r]you hidden from the police, you'll tell us about[r]your last resort.[l][p]
b1_030_0311,Huh? Is that what got you interested?[l][p]
b1_030_0312,Oh! I've got it! You're meaning to steal it[r]for yourself![l][p]
b1_030_0313,Not at all. I'm just curious.[l][p]
b1_030_0314,That excuse will just not do.[l][p]
b1_030_0315,I don't need you two. I'll find a way to stay[r]safe on my own.[l][p]
b1_030_0316,That was a close one! I should've known the only[r]one you can count on in this world is yourself![l][p]
b1_030_0317,Ah...[l][p]
b1_030_0318,We can't let her get away. Let's go after her.[l][p]
b1_030_0319,Stop it! Get any closer and I'll scream![l][p]
b1_030_0320,Please, wait! We'll help you out![r]With no conditions![l][p]
b1_030_0321,Well, you changed your mind quick! That just[r]makes you all the more suspicious![l][p]
b1_030_0322,I tried my best, but I couldn't convince her[r]to stay.[l][p]
b1_030_0323,Could it be you don't know how to handle[r]a girl like that?[l][p]
b1_030_0324,Hmph![l][p]
b1_030_0325,Since she's looking for a safe haven, would[r]you mind me sharing your address with her...just[r]in case?[l][p]
b1_030_0326,Well...[l][p]
b1_030_0327,It doesn't really bother me, but you do recognize[r]there are police officers in my close family?[l][p]
b1_030_0328,At least it'll allow us a way to keep in[r]contact, no matter how small.[l][p]
b1_030_0329,Anyway, how're your plans to resurrect[r]Hokusai going?[l][p]
b1_030_0330,Ah, fortunately that's been going quite well.[l][p]
b1_030_0331,Oh?[l][p]
b1_030_0332,Does that mean you found someone to steal[r]a curse stone from?[l][p]
b1_030_0333,Not exactly, but I've found out a kind of[r]"last resort."[l][p]
b1_030_0334,Which is why I can't let the police get me.[l][p]
b1_030_0335,What do you mean by last resort?[l][p]
b1_030_0336,You're really asking me that?[l][p]
b1_030_0337,It doesn't concern you at all.[r]Why should I tell you?[l][p]
b1_030_0338,Urgh...[l][p]
b1_030_0339,I'm sorry to have worried you, but as I said,[r]I'm making good progress.[l][p]
b1_030_0340,We've reason to believe the curse bearer of the[r]Taiko of Tsugaru was here last night.[l][p]
b1_030_0341,It's possible they're already dead, but we[r]haven't found any definitive leads.[l][p]
b1_030_0342,Ayame Tono says her plans for the Rite of[r]Resurrection may be achievable through this[r]"last resort."[l][p]
b1_030_0343,Does that mean she's given up on her plan to[r]steal a curse stone?[l][p]
b1_030_0344,...[l][p]
b1_030_0345,Richter?[l][p]
b1_030_0346,Hm?[l][p]
b1_030_0347,You know...[l][p]
b1_030_0348,I have one as well...[l][p]
b1_030_0349,A last resort.[l][p]
b1_030_0350,You do?[l][p]
b1_030_0351,Ah...[l][p]
b1_030_0352,Even if we don't steal another curse stone...[l][p]
b1_030_0353,I already have my own.[l][p]
b1_030_0354,If it becomes necessary, I am prepared to use it.[l][p]
b1_030_0355,Hm, so you think it might be possible that she[r]has one of her own, too?[l][p]
b1_030_0356,But that she despises the idea of using it to kill[r]others, so instead she means to steal a curse stone[r]with soul dregs already in it?[l][p]
b1_030_0357,It doesn't contradict anything we know...[l][p]
b1_030_0358,She lives nearby which means she might have[r]the Taiko of Tsugaru curse stone.[l][p]
b1_030_0359,We still don't know much about that one.[l][p]
b1_030_0360,Richter?[l][p]
b1_030_0361,That "last resort" Ayame spoke of...[l][p]
b1_030_0362,It could be our chance.[l][p]
b1_030_0363,...[l][p]
b1_030_0364,We can use her.[l][p]
b1_030_0365,I hear you loud and clear.[l][p]
b1_030_0366,It's likely Ayame Tono's a curse bearer.[l][p]
b1_030_0367,Everyone is relaxing so peacefully in the[r]park...[l][p]
b1_030_0368,It's hard to imagine it was the site of some[r]horrid curse.[l][p]
b1_030_0369,<i>The cops have yet to determine who the[r]remaining curse bearers are. We have to find[r]them soon.[l][p]
b1_030_0370,<i>I can't help but feel oddly irritated around[r]that girl, Ayame Tono.[l][p]
b1_030_0371,<i>She puts on an innocent front, but she seems[r]to be hiding something.[l][p]

b1_030_0375,He's up in front with the kids to participate[r]in the raffle.[l][p]
b1_030_0376,It's weird seeing an adult his age enjoying[r]himself so much at a candy store.[l][p]
b1_030_0377,Look at his smile. He must've won something.[r]How nice.[l][p]
b1_030_0378,Hot damn! It's Mocking Bird #10! Caw Cophony![r]He's a nihilist, but he gets the[r]job done![l][p]
b1_030_0379,Oh... Well, you seem pretty happy.[l][p]

b1_030_0382,It's Fair Feather! The coolest peacock around![l][p]
b1_030_0383,Oh... So it is. That's a pretty big win, huh?[l][p]

b1_030_0385,...Oh, it seems he didn't win anything.[r]He's pouting so hard even the kids are[r]laughing at him.[l][p]
b1_030_0386,Oh, right...ma'am. Should we go for monjayaki[r]or something?[l][p]
b1_030_0387,That's sweet of you, but I'm not hungry right now.[l][p]
b1_030_0388,That's too bad.[l][p]
b1_030_0389,I haven't had great luck with this Mocking Bird[r]raffle. Would you mind if I tried a few more[r]times?[l][p]
b1_030_0390,Apparently most of these are just replicas of the[r]real deal, but even so, they're well worth the price.[l][p]
b1_030_0391,Some of the kids were saying they managed to[r]snatch some real rare finds in this lottery.[l][p]
b1_030_0392,Go ahead. Don't buy them all now.[l][p]
b1_030_0393,Just let me know when you want to leave, okay?[l][p]
b1_030_0394,Okay, okay.[l][p]
b1_030_0395,The shop's close to the park, so children have[r]been coming and going without pause.[l][p]
b1_030_0396,Places like this candy shop have been slowly[r]disappearing from the street view recently.[l][p]
b1_030_0397,Hmm... Sennoya... The children seem pretty[r]fond of this place.[l][p]
b1_030_0398,It looks comparatively new. They must've had[r]renovations done not long ago.[l][p]
b1_030_0399,There are some vending machines.[r]You can buy canned juice for one hundred yen.[l][p]
b1_030_0400,These days, vending machines sell a lot[r]of things besides juice, too.[l][p]
b1_030_0401,Whoa! No way![l][p]
b1_030_0402,Jeez. You made me jump.[l][p]
b1_030_0403,It's Mocking Bird #14, Fal Conman![r]This guy's a real speed demon![l][p]
b1_030_0404,Oh...is that right?[l][p]
b1_030_0405,It's kinda...scary how you even know the exact[r]number with just a simple glance.[l][p]

b1_030_0407,<i>Apparently, Richter likes to visit the local[r]candy shop in every district he visits.[l][p]
b1_030_0408,<i>I figured once you've seen one you've seen[r]them all, but in reality each one has its own[r]unique displays and colors to match the locale.[l][p]
b1_030_0409,<i>It kind of irks me that we stopped here simply[r]for the sake of entertainment.[l][p]
b1_030_0410,<i>But I suppose he needs time like this to relax and[r]re-center his mind. He works so vigorously[r]every day.[l][p]
b1_030_0411,<i>It almost feels like I came here with[r]a child.[l][p]
b1_030_0412,<i>My boy never had much of a taste for sweets.[r]It makes this kind of a fresh experience for me.[l][p]

b1_040_0016,[c30]Reporter
b1_040_0017,We've received an update on the hostage situation.[l][p]
b1_040_0018,The fifty-six-year-old male suspect who announced[r]his intent to commit mass murder in Sumida City[r]today...[l][p]
b1_040_0019,had taken a woman hostage and gone on the run...[l][p]
b1_040_0020,but was found by the police in a park in Sumida[r]after 4 p.m. and confirmed dead.[l][p]
b1_040_0021,The weapon the suspect was said to possess was[r]nowhere to be found on site, and its[r]whereabouts are currently unknown.[l][p]
b1_040_0022,Furthermore, the female hostage was not present,[r]and the search for her continues.[l][p]
b1_040_0023,Interesting.[l][p]
b1_040_0024,If it's being reported on the news, then[r]that lends credence to her story.[l][p]
b1_040_0025,Talk
b1_040_0026,Richter Kai
b1_040_0027,Ayame Tono
b1_040_0028,Think
b1_040_0029,He was quite shaken just moments ago, but he[r]seems better now. You'd think it'd be harder[r]for him to keep his cool...[l][p]
b1_040_0030,I wonder what her intentions are.[l][p]
b1_040_0031,How is she able to act like nothing happened?[l][p]
b1_040_0032,Is this just how girls are these days?[l][p]
b1_040_0033,Anyways, I should ask about her side of the story.[l][p]
b1_040_0034,Calm down, ma'am. If using a curse, one would[r]target a curse bearer.[l][p]
b1_040_0035,...Well?[r]It's just like I said, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0036,The female hostage mentioned on the news just[r]now...[l][p]
b1_040_0037,That must've been you.[l][p]
b1_040_0038,Which means you killed Nejima with your[r]own curse stone?[l][p]
b1_040_0039,Heh, well... You said you'd give me refuge,[r]so I came to take you up on that offer.[l][p]
b1_040_0040,What are you planning?[l][p]
b1_040_0041,Hm? Me?[l][p]
b1_040_0042,Well, obviously.[l][p]
b1_040_0043,I'm onto my last resort.[l][p]
b1_040_0044,...![l][p]
b1_040_0045,You used a curse stone?
b1_040_0046,You're a curse bearer?
b1_040_0047,Introductions
b1_040_0048,So you're a curse bearer with a curse stone,[r]too, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0049,Heheh... Are you surprised?[r]Yes, I have a curse stone of my own.[l][p]
b1_040_0050,It's the Taiko of Tsugaru.[l][p]
b1_040_0051,Then why go after other people's curse stones?[l][p]
b1_040_0052,Um, because killing people is bad, y'know?[r]Don't you think so, too?[l][p]
b1_040_0053,I think so.
b1_040_0054,I don't think so.
b1_040_0055,You're right. It's wrong to kill people for the[r]sake of resurrection.[l][p]
b1_040_0056,Right? And it's not even one for one, so it's hardly[r]a fair exchange.[l][p]
b1_040_0057,I wonder...[l][p]
b1_040_0058,Oh? Are you the type of lady who's willing to[r]sacrifice anything for the sake of[r]your goals?[l][p]
b1_040_0059,That's...man, it sure ain't good. People will[r]question where your parents went wrong,[r]you know?[l][p]
b1_040_0060,Well, people can be harsh...[l][p]
b1_040_0061,Either way, that's why I wanted to only use[r]soul dregs gathered by others.[l][p]
b1_040_0062,But that didn't work out in the end.[l][p]
b1_040_0063,No one had the backbone to use their curse.[r]The world's gone soft...[l][p]
b1_040_0064,With no one mercilessly using their curse[r]in pursuit of their own goals, I had[r]to take matters into my own hands.[l][p]
b1_040_0065,And now people might be wondering where[r]your parents went wrong, hm?[l][p]
b1_040_0066,Well. I suppose, huh? But it had to be done.[l][p]
b1_040_0067,If you say.[l][p]
b1_040_0068,I heard Namigaki, that young man you were with,[r]used his curse stone too.[l][p]
b1_040_0069,Huh? How do you know that?[r]Ick, creepy much! Are you stalking me?[l][p]
b1_040_0070,I may have heard it from a detective I know.[l][p]
b1_040_0071,Ugh, there it is! Cops! Betcha know a bunch![l][p]
b1_040_0072,I know your type. People who boast just[r]'cause they know a couple of cops.[l][p]
b1_040_0073,But the police is filled with nothing but scum...[l][p]
b1_040_0074,My... You seem to hold quite a grudge against[r]the force.[l][p]
b1_040_0075,Speaking of, this guy's really creeping me out.[r]What's the deal with him anyway?[r]You gonna explain?[l][p]
b1_040_0076,Even the way he moves is all weird and[r]exaggerated.[l][p]
b1_040_0077,Right, right.[r]I haven't introduced myself yet.[l][p]
b1_040_0078,I'm...[l][p]
b1_040_0079,Um, no. No thank you.[l][p]
b1_040_0080,...[l][p]
b1_040_0081,So, what were we talking about again?[l][p]
b1_040_0082,Oh, right. Yutaro Namigaki.[r]He's no good, honestly.[l][p]
b1_040_0083,He was such a wuss. I had to spur him on so[r]many times for him to even use his curse,[r]and even then he was pissing his pants![l][p]
b1_040_0084,And just when I take my eyes off him, he[r]hands over his curse stone to someone.[r]Honestly, he's a disappointment.[l][p]
b1_040_0085,So that's what happened.[l][p]
b1_040_0086,Which is why I figured I had to do it myself[r]if I wanted it done right, you know?[l][p]
b1_040_0087,That's what my last resort is...collecting[r]soul dregs on my own.[l][p]
b1_040_0088,So when you were taken hostage by Nejima...[l][p]
b1_040_0089,You used the curse stone in the gardens and swiftly[r]made your getaway?[l][p]
b1_040_0090,Well, yeah.[l][p]
b1_040_0091,I didn't really have time to think on it. At the[r]time I only thought of how to get out[r]of there.[l][p]
b1_040_0092,Then...[l][p]
b1_040_0093,What about now?[l][p]
b1_040_0094,Could you use it again?[r]Your curse stone?[l][p]
b1_040_0095,Well, the curse stone doesn't respond[r]during the day, but...[l][p]
b1_040_0096,It's evening now.[l][p]
b1_040_0097,So, I tried using the curse just now and...yup,[r]it seems I activated it.[l][p]
b1_040_0098,What!? You're using it now?[l][p]
b1_040_0099,It might still be a little weak. I guess it's not[r]supposed to be used repeatedly...[l][p]
b1_040_0100,But I think I could get it to work once more.[l][p]
b1_040_0101,Oh.[l][p]
b1_040_0102,That so...[l][p]
b1_040_0103,Sure is, so I'll give you a final warning...[l][p]
b1_040_0104,It's already started, so be careful, hm?[l][p]
b1_040_0105,It's started?[l][p]
b1_040_0106,What started?[l][p]
b1_040_0107,The curse, of course. All that's left is for[r]the conditions to be fulfilled.
b1_040_0108,……!?[l][p]
b1_040_0109,Let me introduce myself.[r]It's hard to talk as strangers.[l][p]
b1_040_0110,Is it? And are you okay telling me who[r]you are?[l][p]
b1_040_0111,Well... I won't stop you. Do as you please.[l][p]
b1_040_0112,...?[l][p]
b1_040_0113,Well, I am Harue Shigima and this is my house.[r]My father and husband are both with[r]the police.[l][p]
b1_040_0114,Is that so?[l][p]
b1_040_0115,Then you know that cops are just the worst[r]people, right!?[l][p]
b1_040_0116,Well...[l][p]
b1_040_0117,There are certainly many who are cold...[r]especially with their own family.[l][p]
b1_040_0118,In a police family, one is always expected to just[r]grin and bear it, no matter what happens.[l][p]
b1_040_0119,God, I know right?[l][p]
b1_040_0120,What a relief! You understand! I think we[r]might get along![l][p]
b1_040_0121,Oh? Well, I'm glad then.[l][p]
b1_040_0122,And I'm Richter Kai.[r]Private Investigator.[l][p]
b1_040_0123,Ugh, did I ask? But, hmm, you're an investigator?[l][p]
b1_040_0124,So your job is to sneak around and follow[r]people to pry into their secrets, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0125,Oh, is that why you keep probing with all[r]these questions? Ew.[l][p]
b1_040_0126,Guess there's not much I can do to change[r]that terrible impression you got of me.[l][p]
b1_040_0127,Hey lady, why are you working with this[r]dude?[l][p]
b1_040_0128,I asked him to look into something for me.[l][p]
b1_040_0129,Really? It's just that he keeps looking[r]this way...[l][p]
b1_040_0130,Isn't your father a police officer as well?[l][p]
b1_040_0131,That man is not my father.[r]Not in name or deed.[l][p]
b1_040_0132,Sounds like there's some bad blood there.[l][p]
b1_040_0133,I've already legally cut all ties. He even had the[r]nerve to act all high and mighty today,[r]and still refused to help me...[l][p]
b1_040_0134,You met him today?[l][p]
b1_040_0135,Yes, today. Remember that "Chief" Tsutsumi who[r]was chasing Nejima? Well, that's him, my "dad."[l][p]
b1_040_0136,What!?[l][p]
b1_040_0137,You're his daughter?[l][p]
b1_040_0138,Former daughter. I've cut ties.[l][p]
b1_040_0139,He's never acted like a father, so he doesn't[r]deserve the title.[l][p]
b1_040_0140,Hmm...[l][p]
b1_040_0141,You know, I heard something about that Nejima guy.[l][p]
b1_040_0142,Apparently he wanted to get revenge on Chief[r]Inspector Tsutsumi for his arrest by[r]going after his daughter.[l][p]
b1_040_0143,Wait, really!?[l][p]
b1_040_0144,And I heard the police had been searching[r]non-stop to take you into protective[r]custody.[l][p]
b1_040_0145,So that explains why the police were staking[r]out your place, too.[l][p]
b1_040_0146,Man, how could I have known that! They came[r]in such intimidating numbers.[l][p]
b1_040_0147,...Wait? Huh?[r]...Hold on a minute![l][p]
b1_040_0148,Doesn't that mean that Nejima was specifically[r]after my life today!?[l][p]
b1_040_0149,That sounds about right.[l][p]
b1_040_0150,It's a good thing you got out unscathed. Or rather,[r]managed to turn the tables on him.[l][p]
b1_040_0151,...[l][p]
b1_040_0152,Oh! That means legally speaking it was[r]self-defense![l][p]
b1_040_0153,But that truly was quite frightening![l][p]
b1_040_0154,To think I'd have to go through this just for[r]being related to a cop. It's a disgrace.[l][p]
b1_040_0155,...[l][p]
b1_040_0156,It truly is...[r]To cause their own child such trouble...[l][p]
b1_040_0157,I'm sorry...[l][p]
b1_040_0158,Um, it's okay![r]You're not the one that needs to apologize, lady.[l][p]
b1_040_0159,Ah...I'm sorry...[r]It just reminded me of what happened to my son.[l][p]
b1_040_0160,Your son?[r]What happened?[l][p]
b1_040_0161,...[l][p]
b1_040_0162,My child was also kidnapped and murdered in[r]order to enact revenge against the police,[r]you see.[l][p]
b1_040_0163,What? How awful! That's terrible![r]I'm sorry to hear that![l][p]
b1_040_0164,Ah... Now that you say it, I do remember[r]hearing about an incident like that last year.[l][p]
b1_040_0165,That must've been your son, huh?[r]My condolences.[l][p]
b1_040_0166,Now that I think about it, although we've met[r]a few times, I didn't even know your name.[l][p]
b1_040_0167,I guess we're more like acquaintances now.[l][p]
b1_040_0168,She activated her curse!?[r]The curse stones can be used already?[l][p]
b1_040_0169,I let my guard down. I didn't think it could[r]be used this early in the evening...[l][p]
b1_040_0170,Ma'am, please calm down![l][p]
b1_040_0171,Wh-what should I do?[r]Should I keep her talking?[l][p]
b1_040_0172,Which curse stone?
b1_040_0173,Why me?
b1_040_0174,What are your stone's conditions?
b1_040_0175,Nejima's death
b1_040_0176,Do you have a light on you?
b1_040_0177,What is the Taiko of Tsugaru?
b1_040_0178,Beg for forgiveness.
b1_040_0179,What was Nejima's curse stone?
b1_040_0180,What are the Haunting Clappers?
b1_040_0181,What are the Seven Mysteries of Honjo?
b1_040_0182,What is your family like?
b1_040_0183,What do you desire?
b1_040_0184,No. I won't stop it.[r]Besides, for you to get so shaken like that...[l][p]
b1_040_0185,No, instead of talking about that, how about[r]we talk about why you're so shaken...[l][p]
b1_040_0186,As I thought. You have a curse stone, too.[r]You're a curse bearer, aren't you, lady?
b1_040_0187,Yes
b1_040_0188,No
b1_040_0189,...
b1_040_0190,<i>...Well then.[r]How should I proceed?[l][p]
b1_040_0191,<i>Is this what it's like to be rushing to one's doom?[l][p]
b1_040_0192,<i>I hadn't even considered it. Would it be[r]possible to use my stone as well now?[l][p]
b1_040_0193,<i>If it's already active, does that mean we'll[r]die the second we trip her conditions?[l][p]
b1_040_0194,<i>Her proclamation meant she thinks I am a curse[r]bearer...[l][p]
b1_040_0195,<i>Did she find out?[r]Or is this a trick to get me to admit it?[l][p]
b1_040_0196,Yes, I am.[r]I'm sure you've already noticed.[l][p]
b1_040_0197,Well, yeah. Around last night.[r]It was a little too obvious.[l][p]
b1_040_0198,Judging by your address...[r]I'm guessing you've got the Haunting Clappers?[l][p]
b1_040_0199,Yes, that's right.[l][p]
b1_040_0200,There's a lot of soul dregs on the table[r]for killing a curse bearer, you know.[l][p]
b1_040_0201,...I'm well aware.[l][p]
b1_040_0202,Did you get soul dregs when you killed Nejima?[l][p]
b1_040_0203,Of course. His curse stone already contained[r]some soul dregs as well.[l][p]
b1_040_0204,I think...killing one more curse bearer[r]will be enough for the rite.[l][p]
b1_040_0205,You can combine soul dregs across several[r]stones?[l][p]
b1_040_0206,Correct. All it needs is the prerequisite amount.[l][p]
b1_040_0207,As long as you've got that, it doesn't seem to[r]matter where you got them from.[l][p]
b1_040_0208,I see...[l][p]
b1_040_0209,Then...[l][p]
b1_040_0210,You won't mind if I took them, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0211,My, my, lady.[l][p]
b1_040_0212,You're quite motivated, aren't you?[l][p]
b1_040_0213,Ma'am...[l][p]
b1_040_0214,...[l][p]
b1_040_0215,Her Father
b1_040_0216,Tobacco
b1_040_0217,Nejima
b1_040_0218,Her Desire
b1_040_0219,Negotiate
b1_040_0220,Use Curse
b1_040_0221,Your father, the chief inspector...[r]I met him not too long ago.[l][p]
b1_040_0222,Oh, really?[l][p]
b1_040_0223,He came off a little stiff and awkward.[l][p]
b1_040_0224,Haah... There's a surprise.[l][p]
b1_040_0225,But there was something charming about his[r]seriousness... And he seemed like he cared[r]a lot about his daughter.[l][p]
b1_040_0226,Um... Please cut it out.[r]It's gross. You don't know a thing about us.[l][p]
b1_040_0227,Outsiders shouldn't butt into another family's[r]affairs.[l][p]
b1_040_0228,Though he may as well be a stranger to me now.[l][p]
b1_040_0229,Even if you've cut legal ties, you're still[r]related by blood...[l][p]
b1_040_0230,Huh? We're not related at all.[l][p]
b1_040_0231,Huh?[l][p]
b1_040_0232,He probably thought...[l][p]
b1_040_0233,that I never noticed it, but...[l][p]
b1_040_0234,It wasn't hard for me to figure out that[r]I wasn't related to them by blood.[l][p]
b1_040_0235,So you were adopted?[l][p]
b1_040_0236,Well, I got curious, so I looked into it.[r]It was all pretty straightforward.[l][p]
b1_040_0237,I was a baby when they took me in.[r]All they did was raise me.[l][p]
b1_040_0238,...[l][p]
b1_040_0239,My mother first got pregnant shortly after she married.[l][p]
b1_040_0240,But it was a stillbirth.[l][p]
b1_040_0241,...![l][p]
b1_040_0242,The whole affair left a deep wound on her[r]heart. My "father" couldn't bear to see it.[l][p]
b1_040_0243,So it was for her sake that he did it. I was a[r]substitute. A replacement for the child she lost.[l][p]
b1_040_0244,He decided that all by himself.[l][p]
b1_040_0245,He didn't discuss it?[l][p]
b1_040_0246,Maybe he was trying to be thoughtful.[l][p]
b1_040_0247,So, any baby would've been fine. As long as[r]it could've comforted the woman who hoped to[r]become a mother.[l][p]
b1_040_0248,Putting it in such a way...[l][p]
b1_040_0249,It's not easy to raise a child.[l][p]
b1_040_0250,My mother was bewildered. Wouldn't you be? After[r]being told to raise a baby that wasn't your own?[l][p]
b1_040_0251,But she couldn't just abandon the baby either.[l][p]
b1_040_0252,Yet my father just left everything to my mother[r]and never lent a hand.[l][p]
b1_040_0253,He is so damn selfish...[l][p]
b1_040_0254,...[l][p]
b1_040_0255,The two of them grew apart.[l][p]
b1_040_0256,I watched them try and figure out how to[r]understand each other...[r]And the sight of it disgusted me.[l][p]
b1_040_0257,...It was a messed-up family, I tell you.[l][p]
b1_040_0258,Well... I guess my presence was to blame for[r]that rift to begin with.[l][p]
b1_040_0259,You shouldn't say that...[l][p]
b1_040_0260,I know he's bad at expressing himself and has his[r]work, but still, that shouldn't be an excuse.[l][p]
b1_040_0261,But knowing all that, I couldn't take it[r]anymore.[l][p]
b1_040_0262,It just made me want to hurry up and leave[r]home and live on my own.[l][p]
b1_040_0263,I still rely on him for tuition and allowance...[r]But that much is normal for most kids, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0264,I don't want him to start acting like he's[r]my father now just because he's doing the minimum.[l][p]
b1_040_0265,I'm sorry to hear that...[l][p]
b1_040_0266,It sounds like it was tough for all of you.[l][p]
b1_040_0267,...[l][p]
b1_040_0268,I'm sorry... You're right, it's not my place to[r]talk about your family.[l][p]
b1_040_0269,Ah well... I may have said too much.[l][p]
b1_040_0270,To think I spilled all that when I don't[r]even know what the conditions are...[l][p]
b1_040_0271,...Could it be what we were talking about had[r]something to do with the activation conditions[r]for the Haunting Clappers?[l][p]
b1_040_0272,Who knows, hm?[l][p]
b1_040_0273,Ah well... I may have said too much.[l][p]
b1_040_0274,But at least I don't need to worry about[r]activating your conditions.[l][p]
b1_040_0275,...[l][p]
b1_040_0276,Do you smoke?[l][p]
b1_040_0277,Huh? Well...a little.[l][p]
b1_040_0278,Feel free to smoke if you want to, please.[l][p]
b1_040_0279,I'm okay. I don't see any ashtrays out on[r]display either.[l][p]
b1_040_0280,Does no one smoke in this family?[l][p]
b1_040_0281,A little rare, isn't it? Nobody in the family does.[l][p]
b1_040_0282,...[l][p]
b1_040_0283,Then why did you ask me if I did all of a[r]sudden?[l][p]
b1_040_0284,Well...[l][p]
b1_040_0285,Mhm...[l][p]
b1_040_0286,I'm good for now.[l][p]
b1_040_0287,A little abrupt, don't you think?[r]Asking if I smoke?[l][p]
b1_040_0288,...[l][p]
b1_040_0289,Listen, Ayame.[l][p]
b1_040_0290,I have something to ask you.[l][p]
b1_040_0291,No. The answer's no.[l][p]
b1_040_0292,The curse stone in your possession. I...[l][p]
b1_040_0293,I'm not giving it up.[l][p]
b1_040_0294,...[l][p]
b1_040_0295,You're right...[l][p]
b1_040_0296,We're both made of stronger stuff than that.[l][p]
b1_040_0297,You're not giving it up.[l][p]
b1_040_0298,And neither am I.[l][p]
b1_040_0299,...You know full well, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0300,That there's no room left for negotiation here.[l][p]
b1_040_0301,You're right... There's not.[l][p]
b1_040_0302,How did you kill Fumichika Nejima?[l][p]
b1_040_0303,...I'm not telling you.[l][p]
b1_040_0304,I only ask because it does concern me.[l][p]
b1_040_0305,He was one of the reasons my child was kidnapped.[l][p]
b1_040_0306,...[l][p]
b1_040_0307,There's not much to say... We talked and[r]he cleared the conditions for my stone.[l][p]
b1_040_0308,Did he show any signs of remorse over his[r]past crimes?[l][p]
b1_040_0309,It didn't feel like he did, no.[l][p]
b1_040_0310,I...see...[l][p]
b1_040_0311,The world is full of trash men I tell you.[l][p]
b1_040_0312,That's...[l][p]
b1_040_0313,...I agree.[l][p]
b1_040_0314,...[l][p]
b1_040_0315,In a way, I guess you could say you put a stop to[r]Nejima's mass murder schemes.[l][p]
b1_040_0316,Hm, about that.[l][p]
b1_040_0317,There's no guarantee that I won't do it myself.[l][p]
b1_040_0318,Huh?[l][p]
b1_040_0319,I picked up his curse stone of the One-Sided[r]Reed. It really is something else...[l][p]
b1_040_0320,Unfortunately, I can't use a curse stone that's[r]not mine until it's late at night.[l][p]
b1_040_0321,Really?[l][p]
b1_040_0322,Are you okay with telling me that?[l][p]
b1_040_0323,Ah... How silly of me.[r]I let that slip. Teehee.[l][p]
b1_040_0324,What is your wish, Ayame?[l][p]
b1_040_0325,Is it really to resurrect Katsushika Hokusai?[l][p]
b1_040_0326,Yes. There's no life that holds more value than his.[l][p]
b1_040_0327,...Including my own.[l][p]
b1_040_0328,You're saying you'd be willing to die if it[r]meant bringing Hokusai back to life?[l][p]
b1_040_0329,Not all life is equal.[l][p]
b1_040_0330,At least...not to me.[l][p]
b1_040_0331,A life that can birth art with the power to move[r]hearts is infinitely more worthy.[l][p]
b1_040_0332,Compared to that, the life of someone like me,[r]someone that can't produce a thing,[r]has no value.[l][p]
b1_040_0333,That's unhinged.[l][p]
b1_040_0334,I'm still young. It's the age for wild thoughts.[l][p]
b1_040_0335,But...[l][p]
b1_040_0336,Aren't you the same as me?[l][p]
b1_040_0337,What?[l][p]
b1_040_0338,You've got a life more important than your own.[l][p]
b1_040_0339,A life you consider more important than the[r]lives of many others... That's what you're doing[r]it all for, isn't it?[l][p]
b1_040_0340,...[l][p]
b1_040_0341,You're right.[l][p]
b1_040_0342,If I can save my son...[l][p]
b1_040_0343,I couldn't care less about my life...or the[r]lives of others.[l][p]
b1_040_0344,Who's unhinged now?[l][p]
b1_040_0345,I'm a mother, it is what it is.[l][p]
b1_040_0346,Dang. The feelings of a proper parent are[r]something else.[l][p]
b1_040_0347,But if that's your wish, then...[l][p]
b1_040_0348,What do you plan on doing if you don't get[r]your wish?[l][p]
b1_040_0349,Oh... I haven't thought of it.[l][p]
b1_040_0350,I might just keep on trying to bring[r]Hokusai back some other way.[l][p]
b1_040_0351,You really are obsessed.[l][p]
b1_040_0352,You and Hihaku's chairwoman might be cut[r]from the same cloth.[l][p]
b1_040_0353,Who's that?[l][p]
b1_040_0354,She's like an all-powerful vortex of obsession[r]turned to yokai-level proportions.[l][p]
b1_040_0355,Hmm, you're saying I'll end up like her?[l][p]
b1_040_0356,Are you looking forward to such a future?[l][p]
b1_040_0357,I'd rather not have to wait till I'm old and[r]creaking.[l][p]
b1_040_0358,I want it to happen now.[l][p]
b1_040_0359,I'll put my life on the line for Hokusai.[l][p]
b1_040_0360,Ah...[l][p]
b1_040_0361,Did you try to use your curse?[r]Just now?[l][p]
b1_040_0362,...[l][p]
b1_040_0363,It seems I didn't meet your curse's conditions.[l][p]
b1_040_0364,I wonder if it was smart to secretly toss[r]the lighter I was carrying earlier?[l][p]
b1_040_0365,...![l][p]
b1_040_0366,When did...[l][p]
b1_040_0367,You made a mistake when you decided to[r]ask me about smoking.[l][p]
b1_040_0368,If a source of fire is the condition for your stone...[r]Then you won't see me falling for it now.[l][p]
b1_040_0369,...[l][p]
b1_040_0370,You wasted your chance with all this chatter. All[r]you needed to do was activate your curse first.[l][p]
b1_040_0371,I brought everything Nejima had on him.[r]Including the lighter he was holding.[l][p]
b1_040_0372,...[l][p]
b1_040_0373,But it's over now...[l][p]
b1_040_0374,Yes, I concede...[l][p]
b1_040_0375,It's pointless I'm telling you.[l][p]
b1_040_0376,All righty.[l][p]
b1_040_0377,With your cards on the table, you're out[r]of options.[l][p]
b1_040_0378,...[l][p]
b1_040_0379,It might be possible for Mr. Investigator there[r]to pin me down by force...[l][p]
b1_040_0380,But he's not going to do that, is he?[l][p]
b1_040_0381,Correct. I won't take that risk...not while[r]your curse's conditions are unknown.[l][p]
b1_040_0382,...[l][p]
b1_040_0383,...Coward.[l][p]
b1_040_0384,I came to kill you and acquire your soul dregs[r]but...[l][p]
b1_040_0385,After hearing you out, I got a question[r]for you.[l][p]
b1_040_0386,Why don't you just...give up on the Rite of[r]Resurrection?[l][p]
b1_040_0387,...![l][p]
b1_040_0388,You said it was your son, right?[r]The one you want to bring back?[l][p]
b1_040_0389,But haven't you done enough?[l][p]
b1_040_0390,I'm sure your son is content knowing you[r]cared for him this much.[l][p]
b1_040_0391,...[l][p]
b1_040_0392,I'm truly willing to die to resurrect Hokusai,[r]but...[l][p]
b1_040_0393,You can't say the same, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0394,...![l][p]
b1_040_0395,If you're going to bring your son back, you[r]have to be alive as well, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0396,In fact. What you really want is for both of[r]you to live, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0397,Y-yes...[l][p]
b1_040_0398,Well, even if you both lived to see it.[l][p]
b1_040_0399,Your son would grow up knowing you[r]for who you are: someone who stole the lives of[r]others to bring him back.[l][p]
b1_040_0400,You would be putting the burden of shouldering[r]all the lives sacrificed for him on his little[r]shoulders.[l][p]
b1_040_0401,Are you really okay with that?[l][p]
b1_040_0402,Ngh...[l][p]
b1_040_0403,If you didn't even think about that...[l][p]
b1_040_0404,Then what you're doing is not for your son.[l][p]
b1_040_0405,It's for yourself... Aren't you just bringing[r]him back to fulfill your own desires?[l][p]
b1_040_0406,That's not...[l][p]
b1_040_0407,Ma'am...[l][p]
b1_040_0408,What she's saying may be harsh...but holds[r]a kernel of truth.[l][p]
b1_040_0409,Don't reduce yourself to nothing but a[r]mother who would sacrifice anything for[r]her son.[l][p]
b1_040_0410,But...that's not...![l][p]
b1_040_0411,We discovered the truth behind his kidnapping.[l][p]
b1_040_0412,Next, you should take some time to come[r]understand your own feelings.[l][p]
b1_040_0413,I'll help you every step of the way. Getting to[r]the heart of things is what an investigator[r]does.[l][p]
b1_040_0414,...[l][p]
b1_040_0415,What will you do?[l][p]
b1_040_0416,Ma'am...[l][p]
b1_040_0417,If you relinquish the curse stone to a curse[r]bearer...you will no longer be a curse bearer.[l][p]
b1_040_0418,...You won't be a target anymore.[l][p]
b1_040_0419,Ayame is giving you a chance.[l][p]
b1_040_0420,Think hard...and then give your answer.[l][p]
b1_040_0421,...[l][p]
b1_040_0422,Give up the curse stone.
b1_040_0423,Don't give up the curse stone.
b1_040_0424,Very well.[l][p]
b1_040_0425,...Here.[l][p]
b1_040_0426,Thanks! Glad you could see reason.[l][p]
b1_040_0427,Ma'am... You made the right choice.[l][p]
b1_040_0428,Dang... You really didn't collect any soul[r]dregs, huh?[l][p]
b1_040_0429,I promised myself that if I ever used it,[r]it would be only once.[l][p]
b1_040_0430,But in the end it didn't come down to numbers.[l][p]
b1_040_0431,So they only need to be carrying a flame?[r]This seems pretty practical.[l][p]
b1_040_04310,So they only need to be carrying a flame?[r]This seems pretty practical.[l][p]
b1_040_0432,Well, I'll be taking my leave, then.[l][p]
b1_040_0433,There's no point in going after you for[r]soul dregs so...I'm off to the next[r]curse bearer.[l][p]
b1_040_0434,Do you know who remains?[l][p]
b1_040_0435,You speak as if you've already figured it out.[l][p]
b1_040_0436,Mhm. I've got a pretty good idea from our talk.[l][p]
b1_040_0437,What will you do?[r]Do you plan to stop me?[l][p]
b1_040_0438,...[l][p]
b1_040_0439,It's not my place to intervene.[l][p]
b1_040_0440,All right, then.[l][p]
b1_040_0441,...Hey lady, can I borrow your phone?[l][p]
b1_040_0442,I don't mind.[l][p]
b1_040_0443,But who are you calling?[l][p]
b1_040_0444,Hm? The cops. I think it would be faster if I[r]called them directly.[l][p]
b1_040_0445,Sorry but...[l][p]
b1_040_0446,that won't make me back down...[l][p]
b1_040_0447,...!
b1_040_0448,Ma'am! That lighter!?[r]When did you—!?[l][p]
b1_040_0449,Ah! Aaah...! Wha—!?[r]M-my clothes are on fire![l][p]
b1_040_0450,There does not need to be an open flame...[l][p]
b1_040_0451,as long as there's a spark[r]of fire on you...[l][p]
b1_040_0452,Huh!?[l][p]
b1_040_0453,Ma'am, please![r]Think this through![l][p]
b1_040_0454,AAAAAAAAAHHH![l][p]
b1_040_0455,Haah...haah...ah...
b1_040_0456,Ma'am... Why![l][p]
b1_040_0457,...It was...the only way...[l][p]
b1_040_0458,Richter...[l][p]
b1_040_0459,Could we...[l][p]
b1_040_0460,settle any outstanding tabs now?[l][p]
b1_040_0461,Yeah. Sure.[l][p]
b1_040_0462,Ah. There we go.[l][p]
b1_040_0463,Huh!?[l][p]
b1_040_0464,Ma'am! Ma'am![r]Damn! Did she fulfill the conditions!?[l][p]
b1_040_0465,She sure did![r]Okay, it's time for a beatdown.[l][p]
b1_040_0466,Jeez, why did you try to hide it now of all times?[r]I wouldn't have come if you weren't a curse bearer.[l][p]
b1_040_0467,Aaah...! A...aah...![r]Aaa...agh...AAAAAAHHH!!![l][p]
b1_040_0468,Aaagh! Stop![l][p]
b1_040_0469,Hmm...too bad.[r]She's already dead.[l][p]
b1_040_0470,This is...horrific...[l][p]
b1_040_0471,I'll be taking her curse stone.[l][p]
b1_040_0472,Whoa... Huh...[l][p]
b1_040_0473,All the Haunting Clappers needed was a[r]source of fire? That was a close one.[l][p]
b1_040_0474,Now then...[l][p]
b1_040_0475,What will you do, Mr. Investigator?[l][p]
b1_040_0476,Ngh...[l][p]
b1_040_0477,You're not a curse bearer, so I don't have any[r]reason to kill you.[l][p]
b1_040_0478,But I won't show you mercy if you're going[r]to try and capture me.[l][p]

b1_040_0480,I still don't know how her curse works.[r]It's too risky to make a move...[l][p]
b1_040_0481,Um, your employer's already dead anyway, so...[l][p]
b1_040_0482,There's no reason for you to go out of your[r]way to arrest me, right?[l][p]
b1_040_0483,I could still do my duty as a citizen and report[r]you, you know?[l][p]
b1_040_0484,Oh, what a surprise! This is when you decide[r]to suddenly choose the side of righteousness?[l][p]
b1_040_0485,She was after the same thing, you know?[r]There's no clean hands when it comes[r]to soul dregs.[l][p]
b1_040_0486,...[l][p]
b1_040_0487,Well, it looks like you don't have anything to[r]say about that. I'll be taking my leave, then.[r]Bye-bye.[l][p]

b1_050_0005,Amamori, you got a moment?
b1_050_0006,Of course.[r]What is it, Mr. Richter?
b1_050_0007,I was just curious.
b1_050_0008,Have you heard of the legend of the mother who[r]prayed to the Sumida River and resurrected[r]her dead child?
b1_050_0009,What are you on about?
b1_050_0010,Mhm. The mother searched so desperately for her[r]abducted child that she lost her mind.
b1_050_0011,Her son was found dead in Sumida River, so[r]she then built a mound and continued to[r]pray there until...
b1_050_0012,...her son somehow emerged from the mound,[r]back from the dead.[r]Or so the legend goes.
b1_050_0013,I heard it's being adapted into a Noh play too.
b1_050_0014,Interesting. And?
b1_050_0015,Well, it just had me thinking that legends really[r]do exist...
b1_050_0016,Um... Sorry to ask again, but...
b1_050_0017,What are you on about?
b1_050_0018,Never mind, it is what it is.[r]Welcome to my office![l][p]
b1_050_0019,It might be small and dirty, but welcome![l][p]

b1_050_0025,That's great! It's so much better than becoming[r]a police officer![l][p]
b1_050_0026,Hey, hey, Amamori! Don't you tell the kid to[r]give up on his dreams. I think it's[r]a great idea.[l][p]
b1_050_0027,Why don't you bring us all some tea instead?[l][p]

b1_055_0003,Upon killing Harue Shigima, a fellow curse bearer...[l][p]
b1_055_0004,Ayame Tono obtained more than enough soul dregs[r]for the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
b1_055_0005,However, it turned out that resurrecting someone[r]who died a long time ago required[r]an even larger amount...[l][p]
b1_055_0006,To fulfill her heart's deepest desires, she'd[r]need to harvest more...[l][p]
b1_055_0007,So...[l][p]
b1_055_0008,She waited for the sun to set—for when[r]the Feast of Shadows' effects were at its[r]peak.[l][p]
b1_055_0009,And she used the One-Sided Reed curse stone[r]she had stolen from Fumichika Nejima.[l][p]
b1_055_0010,With it, she proceeded to kill all those[r]whose personal information she knew, starting[r]with those who mattered least to her.[l][p]
b1_055_0011,About the One-Sided Reed<font="MAIN">:[l][p]
b1_055_0012,Kills by dismemberment one whose face, address,[r]name, occupation, and location are all known by[r]the curse bearer.[l][p]
b1_055_0013,Many of them were random men, gullible and[r]disposable, drawn in by the allure of a female[r]university student.[l][p]
b1_055_0014,One noteworthy victim among them was Tetsuo[r]Tsutsumi, who—being a curse bearer himself—[r]was promptly targeted for his soul dregs.[l][p]
b1_055_0015,Tsutsumi's death threw the investigation efforts[r]into disarray, allowing Ayame to evade capture.[l][p]
b1_055_0016,Afterwards, she acquired various address registers[r]and phone books and systematically killed the[r]people listed in them...[l][p]
b1_055_0017,Unsuspecting victims could be safe at home, only[r]to suddenly have their limbs severed.[r]The strange deaths shook society to its core.

c1_010_0026,Hajime Yoshimi
c1_010_0027,Fumichika Nejima
c1_010_0028,...And that's about it.[l][p]
c1_010_0029,Shall we continue our investigation?[l][p]
c1_010_0030,We could go to Komagata High School to look[r]into Hitomi Okuda. Or to Michiyo Shiraishi's[r]house to find out more about her.[l][p]
c1_010_0031,A total of [c3]three[c0] mysterious deaths were confirmed[r]in the area. Including the one in this park.[l][p]
c1_010_0032,So let's start with that one...[r]The young man we found here.[l][p]
c1_010_0033,He's been identified as [c4]Shogo Okiie[c0], twenty-five[r]years old. A regular ol' office worker who[r]worked around here.[l][p]
c1_010_0034,He died of asphyxiation due to water in the lungs.[r]...He drowned.[l][p]
c1_010_0035,He drowned? In the middle of the park?[l][p]
c1_010_0036,That's not possible...[r]It's gotta be a curse we're dealing with here.[l][p]
c1_010_0037,About that, Boss. Isn't this park associated[r]with one of those Seven Mysteries, too?[l][p]
c1_010_0038,Yeah, the Whispering Canal.
c1_010_0039,Yeah, the Fool's Procession.
c1_010_0040,Yeah, the Beckoning Light.
c1_010_0041,Yeah, the Haunting Clappers.
c1_010_0042,Yeah, the Evergreen Beech.
c1_010_0043,Yeah, the Taiko of Tsugaru.
c1_010_0044,Yeah, the Foot-Washing Mansion.
c1_010_0045,Yeah, the One-Sided Reed.
c1_010_0046,Yeah, the Everburning Lantern.
c1_010_0047,Huh? No, not that one.[r]Wasn't it the Whispering Canal...?[l][p]
c1_010_0048,Ah, right. Yeah, that's the one.[l][p]
c1_010_0049,That's right. The Whispering Canal![l][p]
c1_010_0050,It does seem like there'd be a link between a[r]canal and death by drowning, don'tcha think?[l][p]
c1_010_0051,Sharp thinking, Erio.[r]You're starting to get the hang of this.[l][p]
c1_010_0052,So, let's assume they're related. What's next?[l][p]
c1_010_0053,Before that, the body of a woman was found[r]behind a residential complex in Kamezawa.[l][p]
c1_010_0054,The victim has been identified as [c4]Tawako Hayashi[c0],[r]twenty-nine years old. She was an office worker[r]who lived on her own in the area.[l][p]
c1_010_0055,As for the cause of death... Well...[l][p]
c1_010_0056,Yes?[l][p]
c1_010_0057,The entirety of her body was crushed by some[r]kind of strong external force.[l][p]
c1_010_0058,No murder weapon was discovered in the area,[r]but considering the way she was found...[l][p]
c1_010_0059,We're looking for something large, flat, and heavy[r]that could've crushed her in one fell swoop.[l][p]
c1_010_0060,Hang on, are you saying...[l][p]
c1_010_0061,She was [c3]stepped on[c0]...? Meaning...
c1_010_0062,Uh, Boss? Pretty sure the curse associated with[r]crushing is the Foot-Washing Mansion...[l][p]
c1_010_0063,Ah, right. That's the one.[l][p]
c1_010_0064,Exactly. Crushing is the Foot-Washing Mansion's[r]modus operandi.[l][p]
c1_010_0065,The place the body was discovered is also known[r]to be related to the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
c1_010_0066,Then is this Namigaki's doing?[r]Shit, I knew he'd used it![l][p]
c1_010_0067,Judging by the amount of soul dregs, the victim[r]was just a regular person, not a curse bearer.[l][p]
c1_010_0068,Guess we should report this to Paranormal Affairs...[l][p]
c1_010_0069,Got it. And as for the third victim...[l][p]
c1_010_0070,He was identified as [c4]Kohei Jonouchi[c0], thirty-two,[r]a teacher at Komagata High. He was found in the[r]school's courtyard.[l][p]
c1_010_0071,Cause of death appears to be external trauma[r]from a fall or heavy blow. The impact crushed[r]his arms and legs.[l][p]
c1_010_0072,Since he was found in the middle of courtyard,[r]he couldn't have fallen from the gymnasium[r]or the main building.[l][p]
c1_010_0073,A teacher dying at school...[l][p]
c1_010_0074,And not just any school. Komagata houses one[r]of the Seven Mysteries...
c1_010_0075,The Whispering Canal.
c1_010_0076,The Fool's Procession.
c1_010_0077,The Beckoning Light.
c1_010_0078,The Haunting Clappers.
c1_010_0079,The Evergreen Beech.
c1_010_0080,The Taiko of Tsugaru.
c1_010_0081,The Foot-Washing Mansion.
c1_010_0082,The One-Sided Reed.
c1_010_0083,The Everburning Lantern.
c1_010_0084,Um... I believe it houses the Fool's Procession.[l][p]
c1_010_0085,That's right. I was going to say that one.[r]I swear.[l][p]
c1_010_0086,Right! It's where the Fool's Procession is[r]supposed to be. It's too big of a coincidence...[l][p]
c1_010_0087,We can't rule out the possibility that this[r]death was also the work of a curse.[l][p]
c1_010_0088,Ah, so that's why the school's closed...[l][p]
c1_010_0089,That's right.[l][p]
c1_010_0090,I see. Either way, it seems all three victims[r]can be tied to the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
c1_010_0091,There's probably a curse bearer at the center[r]of it all, pulling the strings...[l][p]
c1_010_0092,But uh... Aren't you a little too blasé about[r]these Seven Mysteries, Boss?[l][p]
c1_010_0093,Ugh, shut it. None of 'em make any sense![l][p]
c1_010_0094,But you've got a point. All these strange deaths[r]do point in one direction.[l][p]
c1_010_0095,That's right. And Hajime's case wasn't all that[r]different either.[l][p]
c1_010_0096,He also died of mysterious causes in a place[r]connected to the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
c1_010_0097,Problem is that the timing doesn't match up.[r]He died before the curses were activated.[l][p]
c1_010_0098,Hmm...[l][p]
c1_010_0099,Could he have been hit by a different curse?[r]One that didn't have anything to do with the[r]Seven Mysteries?[l][p]
c1_010_0100,Hmm. That's a thought. But...[l][p]
c1_010_0101,If that were the case, we'd be dealing with a[r]powerful practitioner. One who could pull off a[r]curse like that without using a curse stone.[l][p]
c1_010_0102,There aren't many people in this day and age[r]who could do something like that.[l][p]
c1_010_0103,Oh, really? I see...[r]I don't know too much about that stuff.[l][p]
c1_010_0104,I'd be more surprised if you did...[l][p]
c1_010_0105,Well, looking at these deaths, it seems like many[r]of the curse bearers acted last night.[l][p]
c1_010_0106,But we can't rule out that there were more[r]killings from which the bodies haven't been found.[l][p]
c1_010_0107,Yikes. I hadn't thought of that.[l][p]
c1_010_0108,But...there is one silver lining.[l][p]
c1_010_0109,Judging by my own curse stone, it seems that the[r]curses can't be activated while the sun's out.[l][p]
c1_010_0110,Oh, that's great news![r]So basically, we're safe during the daytime?[l][p]
c1_010_0111,Exactly. It's also likely why Nejima gave us[r]till dusk.[l][p]
c1_010_0112,Ah, he must've known the curse stones couldn't[r]be used during the day.[l][p]
c1_010_0113,Either way, we got till nightfall to settle this.[r]It's time we flushed out the other curse bearers.[l][p]
c1_010_0114,Aye, aye, Boss! Let's do this![l][p]
c1_010_0115,At the moment we only know the identity of[r]four curse bearers, you included.[l][p]
c1_010_0116,Yutaro Namigaki had the Foot-Washing Mansion,[r]and Hideki Araishi had the Everburning Lantern.[l][p]
c1_010_0117,We've got both of their curse stones.[l][p]
c1_010_0118,And then there's Nejima, who claims he has[r]the One-Sided Reed.[l][p]
c1_010_0119,Yeah. That about sums it up.[l][p]
c1_010_0120,We'd better figure out who the remaining five[r]are quick.[l][p]
c1_010_0121,How should we go about looking for them?[l][p]
c1_010_0122,There's no point in searching blindly without[r]a lead. Let's focus on other things for now.[l][p]
c1_010_0123,Tracking down Nejima may lead us to the other[r]curse bearers, too.[l][p]
c1_010_0124,Either way, he should be our top priority.[r]He could do some real damage if we don't get him.[l][p]
c1_010_0125,I also want to look a little more into Yoshimi.[r]I've got a feeling there's some connection there.[l][p]
c1_010_0126,Aye, aye, Boss![r]Sounds like we've got our work cut out for us![l][p]
c1_010_0127,I asked around Sumida's Community Safety Bureau,[r]where Yoshimi was stationed.[l][p]
c1_010_0128,It seems like he was investigating the apparent[r]suicide of a girl named Michiyo Shiraishi.[l][p]
c1_010_0129,Ah, yeah... I heard about that.[l][p]
c1_010_0130,He was trying to determine whether it really was a[r]suicide. Looking into the height of the building,[r]the force of the impact, her wounds, all that.[l][p]
c1_010_0131,He must've suspected some kind of foul play,[r]'cause he ordered a full investigation.[l][p]
c1_010_0132,But it'd already been deemed a suicide, and his[r]superiors told him not to go stirring things up.[l][p]
c1_010_0133,Huh. What was the evidence?[l][p]
c1_010_0134,Well, according to the report I found on his[r]desk last night...[l][p]
c1_010_0135,The body was found at the foot of a building,[r]a ways away from the road.[l][p]
c1_010_0136,There was no evidence of vehicular collision,[r]so it was ruled a suicide. But...[l][p]
c1_010_0137,But...he thought there was more to it?[l][p]
c1_010_0138,Yes. A truck or other flat-faced vehicle traveling[r]at high speeds could've inflicted similar damage.[l][p]
c1_010_0139,In other words, sometimes a [c3]traffic accident can[r]look an awful lot like a fall[c0].
c1_010_0140,So there is a chance that it wasn't a suicide...![l][p]
c1_010_0141,But what a terrible way to go...[l][p]
c1_010_0142,There were no brake marks on the road, meaning[r]it would've been a hit-and-run.[l][p]
c1_010_0143,The vehicle would've hit her without slowing down[r]at all.[l][p]
c1_010_0144,This is turning into quite the grisly case...[l][p]
c1_010_0145,But the vehicle couldn't have come out from a[r]collision like that unscathed.[l][p]
c1_010_0146,Exactly. So I asked the Traffic Bureau to keep[r]an eye out for any vehicles with frontal damage.[l][p]
c1_010_0147,But I haven't heard back from them yet.[r]I don't think they're looking very hard...[l][p]
c1_010_0148,So we've got no proof.[l][p]
c1_010_0149,That said, if it was a traffic accident rather[r]than a suicide...[l][p]
c1_010_0150,It's possible that someone silenced Yoshimi[r]because he was on the verge of[r]discovering the truth.[l][p]
c1_010_0151,That's true...[l][p]
c1_010_0152,You think the driver is the one who did him in?[l][p]
c1_010_0153,Not quite. Yoshimi had already talked to[r]Forensics and the Traffic Bureau, right?[r]His death wouldn't have covered things up.[l][p]
c1_010_0154,You're right on that...[l][p]
c1_010_0155,Even if the suicide was a cover-up for a[r]hit-and-run, it doesn't seem like enough[r]reason to kill a cop.[l][p]
c1_010_0156,Hmm...[l][p]
c1_010_0157,...Oh, that's right![r]Unrelated, but I got something else, too.[l][p]
c1_010_0158,I managed to get a hold of Michiyo Shiraishi's[r]address![l][p]
c1_010_0159,Yoshimi went there a bunch over the course of[r]his investigation. Might be a good idea for us[r]to drop by too.[l][p]
c1_010_0160,Good thinking.[r]Hopefully that'll give us some more leads.[l][p]
c1_010_0161,...All right, let's move on to the next topic.[l][p]
c1_010_0162,Remember the girl Yoshimi met with the day he died?[r]One Hitomi Okuda?[l][p]
c1_010_0163,Community Safety didn't have any contact information[r]for her on hand.[l][p]
c1_010_0164,Not even an address?[l][p]
c1_010_0165,Well, they had her parents' information. But when[r]I called, they said they hadn't heard from her[r]in a month.[l][p]
c1_010_0166,Lots of family issues, from the sound of it.[r]They even said they didn't want anything to do[r]with her anymore.[l][p]
c1_010_0167,That said, she still goes to school once in a[r]while, so we might be able to find her there.[l][p]
c1_010_0168,Not sure we really have the time for a stakeout[r]right now...[l][p]
c1_010_0169,But she could be a key witness. Can't we have[r]Community Safety track her down for us?[l][p]
c1_010_0170,We can ask, but it might be tricky to get it[r]done today.[l][p]
c1_010_0171,For starters, Komagata High School is closed[r]today.[l][p]
c1_010_0172,Ah, because of the teacher that died?[l][p]
c1_010_0173,That's right.[l][p]
c1_010_0174,Really... Was there more to it?[l][p]
c1_010_0175,You could say that...[r]I'll explain more later.[l][p]
c1_010_0176,All right. But if it's not something we can do[r]today, we may have to forget about it.[l][p]
c1_010_0177,Let's move on, then.[l][p]
c1_010_0178,I got some information about Yoshimi's fiancée[r]from Community Safety.[l][p]
c1_010_0179,Her name is [c0]Mayu Chozawa[c4], twenty-seven years old.[r]She works as a beautician in the area.[l][p]
c1_010_0180,Look, I even managed to get a picture of her.[r]She sure is a beauty![l][p]
c1_010_0181,But...[l][p]
c1_010_0182,Oh boy. Here it comes.[r]But what?[l][p]
c1_010_0183,Community Safety hasn't been able to contact her[r]since Yoshimi died. Not by phone or at her house.[l][p]
c1_010_0184,In other words, no response. Dead silence.[l][p]
c1_010_0185,There it is. Can't things just be easy for once?[l][p]
c1_010_0186,It's definitely starting to look suspect.[r]A crime of passion, perhaps?[l][p]
c1_010_0187,Hmm...[l][p]
c1_010_0188,It is fairly common for people to be killed by[r]a lover or a spouse.[l][p]
c1_010_0189,But Yoshimi was well-liked, and they'd been[r]together for over ten years.[l][p]
c1_010_0190,You never know. Things could be different behind[r]closed doors.[l][p]
c1_010_0191,I guess so...[l][p]
c1_010_0192,But we'll have to consider the opposite[r]scenario too.[l][p]
c1_010_0193,It could be that the same person who was out for[r]Yoshimi is after his fiancée as well.[r]She could be in danger.[l][p]
c1_010_0194,You're right. Either way, she's important to[r]the case. HQ already has people looking for her.[l][p]
c1_010_0195,We'll know as soon as she's found.[l][p]
c1_010_0196,So... The only two people who might be able to[r]give us a lead are missing.[l][p]
c1_010_0197,That puts us in a tough spot.[l][p]
c1_010_0198,HQ has mobilized a search unit for Nejima.[l][p]
c1_010_0199,But so far, we haven't received any word.[l][p]
c1_010_0200,Guessing he wasn't at home or at work?[l][p]
c1_010_0201,About that... Apparently he [c3]vacated[c0] his last-known[r]address a week ago.
c1_010_0202,You serious!? So we have no idea where he lives!?[l][p]
c1_010_0203,It gets worse. I checked in with the factory[r]he was working at.[l][p]
c1_010_0204,They told me he was only there for a month before[r]he quit.[l][p]
c1_010_0205,Hold on a second.[r]You're telling me nobody caught that?![l][p]
c1_010_0206,Well, I had the same thought, so I spoke to his[r]probation officer.[l][p]
c1_010_0207,Turns out he'd been doing house visits and[r]interviews, but never bothered checking on[r]his workplace.[l][p]
c1_010_0208,He also said he'd lost track of Nejima when he[r]moved to a new place.[l][p]
c1_010_0209,Jeez... That's just sloppy.[l][p]
c1_010_0210,I've heard that they're giving parole to just[r]about anyone these days 'cause they're running[r]out of room in the prisons.[l][p]
c1_010_0211,Which also means there aren't enough probation[r]officers to go around. Dude's probably overworked.[l][p]
c1_010_0212,So Nejima got to fuck about unsupervised...[r]Goddamn it![l][p]
c1_010_0213,That asshole is annoyingly good at faking remorse.[r]Or insanity. Whatever the situation calls for.[l][p]
c1_010_0214,Back when I arrested him all those years ago,[r]just talking to him left a bad taste in my mouth.[l][p]
c1_010_0215,He's probably hiding under a false name...[r]which will make it hard to track him down.[l][p]
c1_010_0216,That'd explain why he so brazenly made contact.[l][p]
c1_010_0217,That asshole. He's mocking us.[l][p]
c1_010_0218,Well, for now, the paperwork to circulate his[r]name and mug shot is being filed.[l][p]
c1_010_0219,That's gonna take way too long.[r]We only have until dusk.[l][p]
c1_010_0220,Speaking of Nejima...[l][p]
c1_010_0221,Yeah?[l][p]
c1_010_0222,Did you manage to reach your daughter?[r]It'd be best to put her into protective custody[r]as soon as possible.[l][p]
c1_010_0223,Not yet. I can't reach her.[l][p]
c1_010_0224,They called, but she's not picking up.[r]Wasn't home when they went to the house, either.[l][p]
c1_010_0225,That's not good...![r]Does that mean she never came home?[l][p]
c1_010_0226,...And why weren't you the one trying to[r]reach her?[l][p]
c1_010_0227,Shut up. I don't have her contact info, all right?[l][p]
c1_010_0228,Damn, she really doesn't trust you, huh.[l][p]
c1_010_0229,Either way, I told her mother that it was an[r]emergency and that we'd send an officer to find[r]her and get her to safety.[l][p]
c1_010_0230,She was real reluctant...but I got her to agree.[l][p]
c1_010_0231,I guess that explains why you got divorced.[l][p]
c1_010_0232,But if you, her former father, can't find her,[r]how the hell did Nejima do it?[l][p]
c1_010_0233,"Former," eh? That cuts deep.[l][p]
c1_010_0234,Yikes, sorry! It just kinda slipped out...[l][p]
c1_010_0235,...Anyway, I suspect it has something to do[r]with his curse echo.[l][p]
c1_010_0236,Back on topic already, huh.[l][p]
c1_010_0237,He said his curse could kill a lot of people[r]in a short time.[l][p]
c1_010_0238,It may even allow him to act from a distance.[l][p]
c1_010_0239,I see...[l][p]
c1_010_0240,The One-Sided Reed...[r]What was that story about again?[l][p]
c1_010_0241,Something about a man stalking a woman...[r]who goes insane and chops her up.[l][p]
c1_010_0242,Ah, right. One of the more gruesome of the[r]Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
c1_010_0243,As for Nejima's whereabouts, all we can do is[r]throw more people at it till we find something.[l][p]
c1_010_0244,I'll check in with HQ frequently to see if[r]they've got any updates.[l][p]
c1_010_0245,<i>...Well. We've got ourselves quite the mess.[l][p]
c1_010_0246,<i>Strange deaths popping up all over the place[r]that may or may not have something to do with[r]the curses.[l][p]
c1_010_0247,<i>We also need to keep looking into Yoshimi[r]and Nejima.[l][p]
c1_010_0248,<i>For now, we'd better start following up on[r]the few leads we've got.[l][p]
c1_010_0249,<i>Guess I'd better see what Erio's found out.[l][p]
c1_010_0250,<i>There's a lot we need to do...[r]but not a lot we can do.[l][p]
c1_010_0251,<i>This ain't looking good. We're gonna run outta[r]time if we don't do something... Gotta keep moving.[l][p]
c1_010_0252,Boss, let's not go about this at random.[r]We should think carefully about where and what[r]to investigate next.[l][p]
c1_020_0001,Start from beginning
c1_020_0002,Start from 9 a.m. at the Shiraishi Household
c1_020_0003,Start from 9 a.m. at Komagata High School
c1_020_0004,Start from conversation with Mio and Yakko

c1_020_0017,It seems like Michiyo's house is at the end of[r]this road.[l][p]
c1_020_0018,We don't want to intimidate them, so maybe I[r]should go alone.[l][p]
c1_020_0019,To the Shiraishi Household
c1_020_0020,!

c1_020_0023,Think
c1_020_0024,Move
c1_020_0025,[c5]Suspend[c0]
c1_020_0026,The houses are really crammed together in these[r]narrow alleyways.[l][p]
c1_020_0027,Strangers like us walking through definitely[r]stand out.[l][p]
c1_020_0028,...It really feels like Old Tokyo.[l][p]
c1_020_0029,...It's quiet.[l][p]
c1_020_0030,This place is normally pretty lively, full of[r]people coming and going.[l][p]
c1_020_0031,But it seems like everyone's decided to stay[r]inside because of the recent incidents.[l][p]
c1_020_0032,Alright, I'll go check the house.[l][p]
c1_020_0033,Erio's off checking the Shiraishi household.[r]I'll just wait till he gets back.[l][p]
c1_020_0034,Looks like no one's home right now.[r]Let's try again later.[l][p]
c1_020_0035,Oh, you're back.[l][p]
c1_020_0036,No luck, Boss.[l][p]
c1_020_0037,No one home?[l][p]
c1_020_0038,Doesn't look like it. I knocked for a while,[r]but nobody came to the door.[l][p]
c1_020_0039,I glanced in the windows, but there was no sign[r]of activity inside either.[l][p]
c1_020_0040,And I saw about three newspapers stuffed into[r]their mailbox.[l][p]
c1_020_0041,Hmph.[l][p]
c1_020_0042,Erio is checking the Shiraishi house at the end[r]of the road.[l][p]
c1_020_0043,This street's real narrow, so two big guys like[r]us would stick out like a pair of sore thumbs.[l][p]
c1_020_0044,Erio looks kind of disappointed.[l][p]
c1_020_0045,<i>So, the Shiraishi household...[l][p]
c1_020_0046,<i>There is a chance that Michiyo didn't actually[r]kill herself.[l][p]
c1_020_0047,<i>It might be for the best that we didn't find[r]her parents.[l][p]
c1_020_0048,<i>Not much we can do if they're not home.[r]Let's go somewhere else for now.[l][p]

c1_020_0053,Here we are. Komagata High.[l][p]
c1_020_0054,Classes are suspended for the day, so the students[r]are just kinda wandering around aimlessly.[l][p]
c1_020_0055,Female Student
c1_020_0056,Talk
c1_020_0057,School Gates
c1_020_0058,Gymnasium
c1_020_0059,School Building
c1_020_0060,The news of the dead teacher has also attracted[r]a fair share of rubberneckers.[l][p]
c1_020_0061,The atmosphere is kinda tense with this many[r]cops around.[l][p]
c1_020_0062,The school gate will stay locked while Forensics[r]inspects the scene of the incident.[l][p]
c1_020_0063,Looks like they're still busy.[r]Let's talk to the person in charge later.[l][p]
c1_020_0064,Komagata High's gymnasium also serves as a[r]polling place and evacuation center.[l][p]
c1_020_0065,A lot of the buildings around here are still made[r]of wood, but this place looks safe and sturdy.[l][p]
c1_020_0066,Yoshimi also looked out for these students as a[r]Sumida City officer.[l][p]
c1_020_0067,Juvenile delinquency has been a growing problem[r]for years now. This school is no exception.[l][p]
c1_020_0068,Hm? Is there something on my shirt?[r]...Don't tell me I stink!?[l][p]
c1_020_0069,Huh? That's—![l][p]
c1_020_0070,...Boss? What is it?[r]You wanna talk to those girls?[l][p]
c1_020_0071,Boss? It really seems like you want to talk to[r]those girls...[l][p]
c1_020_0072,I do!
c1_020_0073,Not really.
c1_020_0074,Yeah, I do. This is divine intervention![r]We were brought here for a reason![l][p]
c1_020_0075,Come on, Erio![l][p]
c1_020_0076,Huh? Wha...?[l][p]
c1_020_0077,...Huh? No, not particularly.[l][p]
c1_020_0078,Oh, all right. I didn't think so...[l][p]
c1_020_0079,This place isn't only connected to the case[r]because the students were under Yoshimi's[r]jurisdiction.[l][p]
c1_020_0080,It's also the site of the Fool's Procession,[r]and of course where that teacher was killed.[l][p]
c1_020_0081,Seems like a likely place to find some clues,[r]don'tcha think?[l][p]
c1_020_0082,The students are just standing around chatting.[r]Guess they've got nothing to do while the school[r]is closed.[l][p]
c1_020_0083,Oh, right. Speaking of schools...[l][p]
c1_020_0084,What is it?[l][p]
c1_020_0085,You said Paranormal Affairs can't help us[r]right now.[l][p]
c1_020_0086,So why don't we get that psychic high schooler[r]you mentioned to help us?[l][p]
c1_020_0087,A lot of the people involved in this case lead[r]back to this school anyway, so it might make[r]things easier to have them with us.[l][p]
c1_020_0088,For a guy who questioned me on the legality of[r]working with them, you sure seem eager to[r]exploit underage labor.[l][p]
c1_020_0089,Hey, who said anything about exploiting them?[r]I just want to give our young experts the[r]opportunity to shine.[l][p]
c1_020_0090,When'd you become such a smooth talker?[l][p]
c1_020_0091,Anyway, I'm afraid I don't know where they are.[l][p]
c1_020_0092,Oh, I see...[l][p]
c1_020_0093,I wonder if there's anyone who could help us[r]scout out the area.[l][p]
c1_020_0094,<i>Ideally we could talk to someone who was involved[r]in the incident... Easier said than done, though.[l][p]
c1_020_0095,<i>9 a.m. A perfectly reasonable time for students[r]to be at school. And yet...[l][p]
c1_020_0096,<i>I doubt this'll be that simple.[l][p]

c1_020_0098,Hey, aren't you...?[l][p]
c1_020_0099,You must be that high schooler skirting the[r]child labor laws who I've heard so much about![l][p]
c1_020_0100,Um... Say that again?[l][p]
c1_020_0101,Sorry 'bout that. He's with me.[l][p]
c1_020_0102,Mr. Tsutsumi... If that's how you feel, maybe you[r]should look into improving my working conditions.[l][p]
c1_020_0103,I'd prefer not to work for free, to be honest...[l][p]
c1_020_0104,Don't you worry 'bout that! If you help us out,[r]you can have whatever you want! Boss's treat![l][p]
c1_020_0105,Wait—[l][p]
c1_020_0106,Really!?[l][p]
c1_020_0107,Thank you so much! I've always wanted to go to[r]a fancy sushi place![l][p]
c1_020_0108,Oooh, yeah! Like one of those places in Ginza?[r]I've never been! Let's go![l][p]
c1_020_0109,We got ourselves a deal! Right, Boss?[r]The girls are at our service![l][p]
c1_020_0110,H-hold on now... What just happened...?[r]I never said I'd... Sushi?[l][p]
c1_020_0111,Looking forward to it, Boss![l][p]
c1_020_0112,Wait, since when were you included?[l][p]
c1_020_0113,Hahaha! You guys are funny.[r]You should do stand-up![l][p]
c1_020_0114,Mio Kurosuzu
c1_020_0115,Yakko Sakazaki
c1_020_0116,Scene of the Crime
c1_020_0117,Forensics is still investigating the area.[l][p]
c1_020_0118,I didn't really want to bring these kids to a[r]place like this, but...[l][p]
c1_020_0119,There were too many onlookers outside for us[r]to speak comfortably.[l][p]
c1_020_0120,Besides, it would be good to have Mio look around[r]the scene, too.[l][p]
c1_020_0121,What's that rope all about?[l][p]
c1_020_0122,It indicates where Jonouchi's body was found.[l][p]
c1_020_0123,They've moved his body, but this way we still[r]have an idea of how it was found.[l][p]
c1_020_0124,Yikes... That's a little...gross.[l][p]
c1_020_0125,You can even see how his arms and legs are all...[r]Eugh![l][p]
c1_020_0126,Cool it, Erio. You're scaring her. This kinda[r]stuff is a little much for a kid.[l][p]
c1_020_0127,Hey, I'm pretty sure she only asked because[r]you were staring at it so intently.[l][p]
c1_020_0128,All right, that's enough...[r]Mio. What do you think?[l][p]
c1_020_0129,I knew it the second I looked at the scene.[r]You're right. Traces of a curse still linger here.[l][p]
c1_020_0130,I figured as much.[l][p]
c1_020_0131,Does that mean Jonouchi was killed by one of[r]the curses of the Seven Mysteries?[l][p]
c1_020_0132,Yes. A strong curse like that always leaves[r]behind a trace.[l][p]
c1_020_0133,Wow, Mio, you're so calm...[r]Are you used to this kind of thing?[l][p]
c1_020_0134,Um... I wouldn't say I'm used to it...[l][p]
c1_020_0135,It just...comes with experience...I guess.[l][p]
c1_020_0136,No? I've heard some stories about you.[l][p]
c1_020_0137,Didn't you investigate a gruesome scene where[r]someone had been killed by a paranormal attack[r]without even breaking a sweat?[l][p]
c1_020_0138,Stop it, Mr. Tsutsumi...[r]She's going to get the wrong idea...[l][p]
c1_020_0139,Whoa! That's amazing![r]Mio, you're a professional![l][p]
c1_020_0140,Y-you think?[l][p]
c1_020_0141,Totally! You're cool even in the face of death![r]That's awesome![l][p]
c1_020_0142,Uh... When you put it like that, I'm not sure[r]how awesome it is...[l][p]
c1_020_0143,So a curse was used here. Which means the[r]curse bearer must've been on the scene too...[l][p]
c1_020_0144,Hey Boss, Forensics is calling.[r]I'll go see what they have to say.[l][p]
c1_020_0145,Sure. Thanks.[l][p]
c1_020_0146,Boss! They found this on the ground a short[r]distance away from the scene![l][p]
c1_020_0147,What is that?[l][p]
c1_020_0148,A...[c4]ribbon[c0]?[l][p]
c1_020_0149,Yeah, the kind you use to tie up your hair.[l][p]
c1_020_0150,Whaaat!? I've seen that ribbon before![l][p]
c1_020_0151,You have? Go on, then.[l][p]
c1_020_0152,That's the ribbon that Michiyo always used[r]to wear!
c1_020_0153,What!?[l][p]
c1_020_0154,Doesn't that mean that Michiyo was here!?[l][p]
c1_020_0155,Are you sure?[l][p]
c1_020_0156,Definitely. I have the same one at home.[r]We bought them together... That has to be hers![l][p]
c1_020_0157,Then...did she come back to life somehow?[l][p]
c1_020_0158,But...how?[l][p]
c1_020_0159,They're still investigating...[l][p]
c1_020_0160,It's usually easier to let Erio do the talking[r]when it comes to young people, but...[l][p]
c1_020_0161,We only have a day.[r]It'll be quicker if I take the reins this time.[l][p]
c1_020_0162,But he did manage to win them over with the[r]promise of food... Let's see how this plays out.[l][p]
c1_020_0163,[c4]Mio Kurosuzu[c0]. She's like a disciple of the[r]Paranormal Affairs Chief.[l][p]
c1_020_0164,I've heard that she helps out with investigations[r]free of charge under the guise of training.[l][p]
c1_020_0165,Although she's my old boss's protégé, she helped[r]me out plenty while I was in Paranormal Affairs.[l][p]
c1_020_0166,She may look meek, but she's got strong spirit[r]sense, sharp instincts, and courage—plus quite[r]the brain to back it all up.[l][p]
c1_020_0167,That said, I can't help but think there's some[r]kind of darkness following her around...[l][p]
c1_020_0168,She's certainly well-versed in the paranormal.[r]I just can't get over the darkness...[l][p]
c1_020_0169,So this is [c4]Yakko Sakazaki[c0]...[l][p]
c1_020_0170,She was with Mio... Could she be...a friend?[r]Did Mio finally make a friend!?[l][p]
c1_020_0171,If she did... It would do this old man's[r]heart good.[l][p]
c1_020_0172,But I better not say that out loud.[r]Don't want to make her look bad.[l][p]
c1_020_0173,This is one hell of a coincidence, huh?[l][p]
c1_020_0174,That this random girl you know is already[r]involved with the case![l][p]
c1_020_0175,So, how much have you been able to figure out?[l][p]
c1_020_0176,Well, I know what happened around midnight[r]last night...[l][p]
c1_020_0177,Someone invoked the Feast of Shadows, which[r]boosts the power of curses, then brought forth[r]the Seven Mysteries of Honjo.[l][p]
c1_020_0178,That allows even those who do not have the power[r]to cast curses to gather soul dregs for the Rite[r]of Resurrection.[l][p]
c1_020_0179,...At least, that's my hypothesis.[l][p]
c1_020_0180,Sounds about right so far.[l][p]
c1_020_0181,As I'm sure you know, there are actually nine[r]Mysteries, not seven.[l][p]
c1_020_0182,When the Feast of Shadows was cast, the curse[r]stones appeared before those who wanted the Rite[r]at the locales of the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
c1_020_0183,We've managed to gather three curse stones[r]so far. Including the one I got first, the[r]Evergreen Beech.[l][p]
c1_020_0184,You got three already? Wow.[l][p]
c1_020_0185,We have the curse stone of the Fool's Procession.[r]Well, Yakko—the girl standing behind me—does.[l][p]
c1_020_0186,That's me![r]Yakko, the girl standing behind Mio![l][p]
c1_020_0187,She does...? Is she all right?[r]We could take it off your hands...[l][p]
c1_020_0188,Well, the Feast of Shadows has no effect during[r]the day, and there's still something I want to[r]find out...[l][p]
c1_020_0189,...[l][p]
c1_020_0190,...All right. I'll leave the Fool's Procession[r]with you two, then.[l][p]
c1_020_0191,Thank you. Please keep collecting the other[r]curse stones. I'll be looking for a way to stop[r]the Feast of Shadows.[l][p]
c1_020_0192,Okay, got it.[r]That should make things go more smoothly.[l][p]
c1_020_0193,What about the other curse bearers?[r]Have you run into any of them?[l][p]
c1_020_0194,Well, last night at school...[l][p]
c1_020_0195,You were here last night?[l][p]
c1_020_0196,Er, yes. You see...[l][p]
c1_020_0197,Huh...[l][p]
c1_020_0198,You two were using a spirit board?[r]That's so cool![l][p]
c1_020_0199,So that's when you ran into the curse echo.[r]I'm glad you survived the encounter.[l][p]
c1_020_0200,Somehow... We managed to get away without[r]accidentally setting it off.[l][p]
c1_020_0201,The curse echo we saw took the shape of [c3]a woman[r]missing an arm and a leg[c0].
c1_020_0202,What!?[l][p]
c1_020_0203,A woman missing an arm and a leg... That's...!
c1_020_0204,The Whispering Canal!
c1_020_0205,The Fool's Procession!
c1_020_0206,The Beckoning Light!
c1_020_0207,The Haunting Clappers!
c1_020_0208,The Evergreen Beech!
c1_020_0209,The Taiko of Tsugaru!
c1_020_0210,The Foot-Washing Mansion!
c1_020_0211,The One-Sided Reed!
c1_020_0212,The Everburning Lantern!
c1_020_0213,Was there something like that in that story?[l][p]
c1_020_0214,I don't think there was...[l][p]
c1_020_0215,Me neither! There definitely wasn't![l][p]
c1_020_0216,Ngh... Okay, okay, I get it...[l][p]
c1_020_0217,Come on, think![r]The lady missing an arm and leg was from...
c1_020_0218,[c3]The One-Sided Reed[c0]! This is bad...[l][p]
c1_020_0219,Huh? What's so bad about that one?[l][p]
c1_020_0220,You idiot! Think![r]The curse bearer of the One-Sided Reed is...!
c1_020_0221,Hajime Yoshimi
c1_020_0222,Yutaro Namigaki
c1_020_0223,Hideki Araishi
c1_020_0224,Fumichika Nejima
c1_020_0225,Shogo Okiie
c1_020_0226,Tawako Hayashi
c1_020_0227,Kohei Jonouchi
c1_020_0228,Michiyo Shiraishi
c1_020_0229,Wait, really? You sure about that?[r]Boss... Are you actually going senile...?[l][p]
c1_020_0230,Er...[l][p]
c1_020_0231,No, no, no, that's not what I meant![l][p]
c1_020_0232,I meant to say that the One-Sided Reed's[r]curse bearer is...
c1_020_0233,Fumichika Nejima! He admitted it himself.[r]That's his curse![l][p]
c1_020_0234,Oh! That's right![r]Wait, but if that's the case...[l][p]
c1_020_0235,...Nejima might've been here last night![l][p]
c1_020_0236,Wha...what!?[l][p]
c1_020_0237,I mean, it's possible he was lying to us, but...[l][p]
c1_020_0238,WHAAAT!?[l][p]
c1_020_0239,Um. Who's Nejima?[l][p]
c1_020_0240,No clue...[l][p]
c1_020_0241,About Fumichika Nejima
c1_020_0242,About the mastermind behind the Feast of Shadows
c1_020_0243,About Hitomi Okuda
c1_020_0244,...So Nejima is trying to take advantage of the[r]Feast of Shadows for his own nefarious purposes.[l][p]
c1_020_0245,Huh!? He said he's going to massacre the city[r]at sundown today!?[l][p]
c1_020_0246,And he's trying to get to your daughter, too!?[l][p]
c1_020_0247,That's why we've been trying to find him...but[r]to no avail. Honestly, this information has been[r]the most useful we've gotten so far.[l][p]
c1_020_0248,So just to be sure... Could you tell me who else[r]was at the school last night?[l][p]
c1_020_0249,Well, as far as we know...[l][p]
c1_020_0250,There was us, Mr. Jonouchi, and one of our[r]classmates, Hitomi.[l][p]
c1_020_0251,Don't forget Old Man Ashimiya.[l][p]
c1_020_0252,Wait, Hitomi? Do you mean Hitomi Okuda?[r]Second-year student?[l][p]
c1_020_0253,Um... Well, yes...[r]Why?[l][p]
c1_020_0254,Boss![l][p]
c1_020_0255,So she was here last night...[l][p]
c1_020_0256,...?[l][p]
c1_020_0257,I saw Hitomi earlier, though, and she didn't[r]seem like a curse bearer to me.[l][p]
c1_020_0258,You did? Did you talk to her!?[l][p]
c1_020_0259,Um... Yes...[l][p]
c1_020_0260,Would you mind if we asked you a few questions[r]about that?[l][p]
c1_020_0261,Hitomi said she didn't want to talk to the police[r]because she was afraid she'd become a suspect.[l][p]
c1_020_0262,So I can't tell you anything unless you swear[r]you won't drag her into this.[l][p]
c1_020_0263,Ah... I see.[l][p]
c1_020_0264,Don't worry. This is about a different matter.[l][p]
c1_020_0265,A different matter?[l][p]
c1_020_0266,You mean about that police officer?[r]Mr. Yoshimi?[l][p]
c1_020_0267,You know about that!?[l][p]
c1_020_0268,Did Hitomi say something about him?[l][p]
c1_020_0269,Yes, she did. Actually...[l][p]
c1_020_0270,If we're talking about people who were at school[r]last night...[l][p]
c1_020_0271,There was one more person, though I'm not too[r]clear on the details.[l][p]
c1_020_0272,There was someone else?[l][p]
c1_020_0273,Apparently Hitomi actually saw Mr. Jonouchi[r]getting cursed and killed last night.[l][p]
c1_020_0274,What!? Talk about some vital information![l][p]
c1_020_0275,What she said happened was...[l][p]
c1_020_0276,Michiyo was the one who killed Mr. Jonouchi!?[l][p]
c1_020_0277,Are you sure it was really Michiyo that she saw!?[l][p]
c1_020_0278,Well, that's what she told me. I wasn't there.[l][p]
c1_020_0279,...[l][p]
c1_020_0280,That must mean there was another curse bearer[r]here last night.[l][p]
c1_020_0281,Jonouchi was killed by a curse, so someone had to[r]have been there, whether it was Michiyo or not.[l][p]
c1_020_0282,Damn, Boss... Do you think it really could've[r]been Michiyo's ghost?[l][p]
c1_020_0283,I mean, based on [c3]what we've heard[c0], she does[r]have plenty of reasons to be vengeful...[l][p]
c1_020_0284,Calm down.[l][p]
c1_020_0285,Just because the paranormal exists doesn't mean[r]just anything is possible.[l][p]
c1_020_0286,It's still possible that Nejima was behind[r]Jonouchi's death.[l][p]
c1_020_0287,But what about Hitomi's story?[l][p]
c1_020_0288,About this janitor. Ashimiya, was it? How old[r]is he? Do you know how long he's worked here?[l][p]
c1_020_0289,Huh? Why are you so interested in him all of[r]a sudden?[l][p]
c1_020_0290,I only just transferred to this school, though,[r]so I have no idea.[l][p]
c1_020_0291,...[l][p]
c1_020_0292,He's around fifty years old. He came to our[r]school about half a year ago.[l][p]
c1_020_0293,No one knows what he did before, so there are[r]all kinds of rumors about him.[l][p]
c1_020_0294,I see...[l][p]
c1_020_0295,Thanks. I think I'm starting to get a better[r]picture of all this.[l][p]
c1_020_0296,Huh...?[l][p]
c1_020_0297,Listen up.[l][p]
c1_020_0298,It's not uncommon for former prisoners to find[r]work under an alias after their release.[l][p]
c1_020_0299,The notoriety attached to their former name can[r]get in the way of proper rehabilitation, you see.[l][p]
c1_020_0300,What are you...? No way![l][p]
c1_020_0301,Erio! Have the officers apprehend the janitor![r]He worked the night shift, so he might still be[r]in the overnight room![l][p]
c1_020_0302,Y-yes! Right away![l][p]
c1_020_0303,Boss, bad news! Apparently the room's been[r]empty all morning![l][p]
c1_020_0304,Sounds like they'd been looking to question[r]Ashimiya too, but couldn't find him anywhere!
c1_020_0305,No...[l][p]
c1_020_0306,That all but confirms it.[l][p]
c1_020_0307,Just one more thing to check. Are there any[r]photos of this Ashimiya?[l][p]
c1_020_0308,Hmm, the old man seriously hated getting his[r]picture taken. He'd always avoid it.[l][p]
c1_020_0309,Erio! Call an urgent search for Makoto Ashimiya![r]We can't let him get away![l][p]
c1_020_0310,Yes, sir! I'll contact HQ right away![l][p]
c1_020_0311,Oh my... I didn't expect this at all...[l][p]
c1_020_0312,Yeah... How could that old man have been some[r]horrible criminal mastermind? I can't believe it.[l][p]
c1_020_0313,And a curse bearer on top of that![l][p]
c1_020_0314,To think he was so close to us this whole time![r]Ugh, it gives me chills![l][p]
c1_020_0315,A guy like that really shouldn't have been[r]allowed to work at a high school...[l][p]
c1_020_0316,Let's hope it isn't already too late.[l][p]
c1_020_0317,Oh![l][p]
c1_020_0318,I, uh... I may have shown Ashimiya my curse stone[r]last night...[l][p]
c1_020_0319,What!?[l][p]
c1_020_0320,I don't like this one bit...[l][p]
c1_020_0321,Nejima did say he wasn't specifically targeting[r]curse bearers, but...[l][p]
c1_020_0322,I'm glad nothing happened to you...[l][p]
c1_020_0323,Wait, but then... Could it have been Old Man[r]Ashimiya who attacked you in the hallway?[l][p]
c1_020_0324,Aaah! I almost told him that you were still[r]in the building, too![l][p]
c1_020_0325,What!? You did!?[l][p]
c1_020_0326,Yikes... Good thing I didn't say anything![l][p]
c1_020_0327,You might've gotten very lucky there, kid.[l][p]
c1_020_0328,This is too much... I hope they find him soon.[l][p]
c1_020_0329,Come on, long arm of the law! Help us![l][p]
c1_020_0330,To put a stop to the Feast of Shadows...[l][p]
c1_020_0331,It would help if I knew more about how the curses[r]of these Seven Mysteries first came about.[l][p]
c1_020_0332,Hmm... In that case, you're probably best off[r]talking to that crabby researcher guy.[l][p]
c1_020_0333,You mean Mr. Araishi?[r]I would very much like to talk to him.[l][p]
c1_020_0334,Ah, right, he's a teacher here too, isn't he?[r]You would know him already.[l][p]
c1_020_0335,He might be more inclined to talk if it's one[r]of his students doing the asking...[l][p]
c1_020_0336,Do you know where he is?[l][p]
c1_020_0337,I do. We tried to talk to him, but he refused[r]to cooperate.[l][p]
c1_020_0338,But you two should give it a try. He's at his[r]usual cafe working on his papers.[l][p]
c1_020_0339,The cafe... Oh, [c4]Kurokikyo Cafe[c0] in Kamezawa?[l][p]
c1_020_0340,Thanks! We'll head over there now.[l][p]
c1_020_0341,Um... School rules say we're not allowed go to[r]cafes, though.[l][p]
c1_020_0342,Don't worry about it. I'll allow it.[l][p]
c1_020_0343,Thank you![l][p]
c1_020_0344,Huh. That's all it takes?[l][p]
c1_020_0345,There must be a mastermind behind everything.[r]Someone who orchestrated all this for a reason.[l][p]
c1_020_0346,I want to find out why.[l][p]
c1_020_0347,Hitomi did say that Mr. Yoshimi entrusted her[r]with something.[l][p]
c1_020_0348,He did? What was it?[l][p]
c1_020_0349,Yoshimi...gave her a talisman?[l][p]
c1_020_0350,Yes... Apparently he also asked her to look for[r]another one just like it—one that Michiyo had.[l][p]
c1_020_0351,What kind of talismans could they be...? Boss?[l][p]
c1_020_0352,Doesn't ring a bell.[l][p]
c1_020_0353,But if Yoshimi was talking about 'em with his[r]dying breath, they must've been pretty important.[l][p]
c1_020_0354,Did they find a talisman on Michiyo where her[r]body was found?[l][p]
c1_020_0355,I'll check, but if they did, Yoshimi would've[r]had plenty of time to retrieve it before he died.[l][p]
c1_020_0356,Right...[l][p]
c1_020_0357,Would you consider giving us Hitomi's contact[r]information?[l][p]
c1_020_0358,I'd like to talk to her about this talisman.[l][p]
c1_020_0359,I'm not sure... She never opened up to anyone[r]except Mr. Yoshimi.[l][p]
c1_020_0360,I'm no good, huh?[r]I was friends with Yoshimi, though...[l][p]
c1_020_0361,You don't seem like too bad of a guy...[r]Not all that scary for a cop.[l][p]
c1_020_0362,But I doubt that'll be enough for her. She really[r]doesn't want to end up becoming a suspect.[l][p]
c1_020_0363,To be honest, she was even a bit wary of us.[l][p]
c1_020_0364,Hmm... Well, then...[l][p]
c1_020_0365,Do you think she'd talk to [c3]Yoshimi's fiancée[c0]?[r]Haven't they met before?[l][p]
c1_020_0366,Oh! They have! She told us about that.[l][p]
c1_020_0367,Yes... She might be willing to talk to her.[l][p]
c1_020_0368,All right. Then we better find her fast.[l][p]
c1_020_0369,You haven't been able to reach her?[r]That's a little worrying...[l][p]
c1_020_0370,Mayu Chozawa... We'll let you know as soon as[r]we manage to contact her.[l][p]
c1_020_0371,Okay. I'd be willing to give Hitomi's contact[r]information to her.[l][p]
c1_020_0372,Oh, right. One more thing. Hitomi told me[r]that Mr. Yoshimi gave her instructions in the[r]event that something happened to him.[l][p]
c1_020_0373,He told her to give the talisman to Mr. Nakagoshi[r]from the police headquarters.[l][p]
c1_020_0374,What!? So it was a Nakagoshi case...?[l][p]
c1_020_0375,Hmm... Why would Yoshimi tell her that...?[l][p]
c1_020_0376,Could you check on that?[l][p]
c1_020_0377,I will, but... Well, I don't know if they'll[r]pick up when I call.[l][p]
c1_020_0378,Is he with the Paranormal Affairs Bureau?[l][p]
c1_020_0379,Well, yes. Nakagoshi's the chief. But he's almost[r]never in, so I don't really know the guy.[l][p]
c1_020_0380,To be honest, I'm not even sure if he exists[r]or if he's just a figurehead.[r]I've never spoken to him myself.[l][p]
c1_020_0381,All of Paranormal Affairs' cases are referred[r]to as "Nakagoshi cases."[l][p]
c1_020_0382,Jeez. What's up with that...?[l][p]
c1_020_0383,That amulet Hitomi was looking for may be the[r]missing puzzle piece to this mystery.[l][p]
c1_020_0384,Um, what was that thing you mentioned about[r]Michiyo earlier?[l][p]
c1_020_0385,Something about a grudge?[r]Did you know anything about her?[l][p]
c1_020_0386,Uh...[l][p]
c1_020_0387,What's your relation?[l][p]
c1_020_0388,I'm her friend. I was actually planning to[r]resurrect her at first...[l][p]
c1_020_0389,Ah... I see.[l][p]
c1_020_0390,We gained quite a lot of information from you two.[r]It's only fair we share as well. Tell her, Erio.[l][p]
c1_020_0391,...All right.[l][p]
c1_020_0392,Keep in mind that this is just a theory, though.[l][p]
c1_020_0393,Okay...[l][p]
c1_020_0394,After re-examining the crime scene, Yoshimi[r]concluded that Michiyo's death wasn't a suicide[r]but a vehicular collision.[l][p]
c1_020_0395,Wait, what!? An accident!?[l][p]
c1_020_0396,Being hit by a speeding truck or van would've[r]resulted in similar injuries.[l][p]
c1_020_0397,The investigation was ordered by Yoshimi, so it[r]seems he had his doubts about it being a suicide.[l][p]
c1_020_0398,Wha...? A van...? Speeding...!?[l][p]
c1_020_0399,Yakko!? What's wrong? Are you okay?[l][p]
c1_020_0400,Aaa...aaah...![l][p]
c1_020_0401,AAAAAAHHH!
c1_020_0402,A van... There's...a young man...in the driver's[r]seat... In the passenger's seat...a woman?
c1_020_0403,Yakko![l][p]
c1_020_0404,Ah...! Huh? Yes![l][p]
c1_020_0405,Wait... Was I...?[l][p]
c1_020_0406,Are you back now? How do you feel?[r]You're covered in sweat...[l][p]
c1_020_0407,Haah... Haah...[l][p]
c1_020_0408,Yeah... I'm okay. I think.[l][p]
c1_020_0409,Sorry... I went a little crazy there.[l][p]
c1_020_0410,It's no problem. As long as you're okay.[r]That was quite the surprise, though.[l][p]
c1_020_0411,...[l][p]
c1_020_0412,Um, Yoshimi talked to you about Michiyo,[r]didn't he?[l][p]
c1_020_0413,Well, he didn't give me any specifics, if you're[r]wondering about that...[l][p]
c1_020_0414,So I don't know what was truly on Michiyo's[r]mind either.[l][p]
c1_020_0415,Right...[l][p]
c1_020_0416,Do you have any idea why Jonouchi was so scared[r]of Michiyo?[l][p]
c1_020_0417,Well... About that...[l][p]
c1_020_0418,I'm not sure exactly how to put this, but...[l][p]
c1_020_0419,...I see. Well, I half-expected it was something[r]like that. Thank you for telling me.[l][p]
c1_020_0420,Sorry... It's hard to explain...[l][p]
c1_020_0421,I wonder what he got his hands on to be able[r]to blackmail her like that.[l][p]
c1_020_0422,Michiyo... What happened...?[l][p]
c1_020_0423,If I was Michiyo and I came back to life...[l][p]
c1_020_0424,Where would I go?[l][p]
c1_020_0425,That's the question.[l][p]
c1_020_0426,She got her revenge on Jonouchi...but she may[r]have more revenge to dish out.[l][p]
c1_020_0427,Is there anyone else she'd have a grudge against?[l][p]
c1_020_0428,Well...[l][p]
c1_020_0429,What about the guy who killed her in the collision?[l][p]
c1_020_0430,...[l][p]
c1_020_0431,If she really did come back to life...[l][p]
c1_020_0432,then it's terribly sad that she's spending her[r]new chance at life like this.[l][p]
c1_020_0433,Being obsessed with revenge is such a tragic way[r]to live.[l][p]
c1_020_0434,...[l][p]
c1_020_0435,Huh? You want to talk to me?[l][p]
c1_020_0436,Uh... You'd probably be better off asking Mio![l][p]
c1_020_0437,<i>Sushi, huh? Well, if that'll solve the case,[r]it's a small price to pay.[l][p]
c1_020_0438,<i>I'll just expense it to Paranormal Affairs later.[l][p]
c1_020_0439,<i>Jonouchi was almost definitely killed by a curse.[l][p]
c1_020_0440,<i>But I wonder about the exact cause of death...[l][p]
c1_020_0441,<i>If the curse's origin and the cause of death are[r]connected, it could give us another lead.[l][p]
c1_020_0442,<i>We'll leave the curse-lifting to the girls while[r]we go looking for Nejima and Chozawa.[l][p]
c1_020_0443,<i>There's also the matter of Yoshimi's talisman.[l][p]
c1_020_0444,<i>But we won't get anything done staying here.[r]We better get a move on.[l][p]
c1_020_0445,I'm afraid that's all we can tell you.[l][p]
c1_020_0446,Don't worry, you were a big help.[r]Thank you.[l][p]
c1_020_0447,We should start our search for Nejima and Mayu[r]Chozawa.[l][p]
c1_020_0448,It might be worth it to check Michiyo's house[r]as well, just in case.[l][p]
c1_020_0449,Let's use the school as our base of operations.[r]If anything happens, go to one of the officers[r]hanging around here.[l][p]
c1_020_0450,Got it. Thank you, and good luck.[l][p]
c1_020_0451,We'll go talk to Mr. Araishi about a way to[r]lift this curse.[l][p]
c1_020_0452,All right, Boss.[r]Let's get going whenever you're ready.[l][p]

c1_030_0009,Boss![l][p]
c1_030_0010,I just talked to the Sumida police![l][p]
c1_030_0011,Oh? What now?[l][p]
c1_030_0012,They found an abandoned van in the Chiba mountains[r]that looked like it'd been in an accident.[l][p]
c1_030_0013,They couldn't lift any fingerprints from it,[r]but they found blood splatters on the front.[l][p]
c1_030_0014,And guess what?[r]The blood is a perfect match for Michiyo's!
c1_030_0015,Oho...[l][p]
c1_030_0016,So it must be the van that hit Michiyo...[l][p]
c1_030_0017,You got it. It's all thanks to Yoshimi that we[r]were able to find that out.[l][p]
c1_030_0018,The license plate had been removed, though, and[r]they even scraped off the vehicle identification[r]number. It'll take a while to identify the owner.[l][p]
c1_030_0019,Now they're trying to figure out if the van was[r]sighted anywhere between the scene of the crime[r]and where it was dumped.[l][p]
c1_030_0020,Got it. Thanks for the report.[l][p]
c1_030_0021,Talk
c1_030_0022,Jun Erio
c1_030_0023,!
c1_030_0024,Think
c1_030_0025,Move
c1_030_0026,He still doesn't look tired after all this[r]running around. Wish I still had all that stamina.[l][p]
c1_030_0027,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori15 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #15[c0] discovered!
c1_030_0028,By the way, Boss.[l][p]
c1_030_0029,We've confirmed that Michiyo died in a[r]vehicular collision.[l][p]
c1_030_0030,But are we sure that it was really...an accident?[l][p]
c1_030_0031,Good question. I was wondering the same thing.[l][p]
c1_030_0032,The damage done by the collision indicates that[r]the driver was traveling at a considerable speed,[r]but there were no brake marks to be found.[l][p]
c1_030_0033,Exactly. Which suggests they may have been[r]intentionally targeting Michiyo.[l][p]
c1_030_0034,Then what was the motive, you think?[l][p]
c1_030_0035,Who would have reason to kill Michiyo...[l][p]
c1_030_0036,The first person that comes to mind is Kankichiro[r]Iwai. After all, she knew about his crimes.[l][p]
c1_030_0037,But then...Iwai was supposedly able to control[r]Michiyo by intimidation alone.[l][p]
c1_030_0038,There's also that teacher who was taking[r]advantage of Michiyo. Kohei Jonouchi.[l][p]
c1_030_0039,But to say he killed her to stop people from[r]finding out that he was blackmailing her...[r]doesn't seem likely somehow.[l][p]
c1_030_0040,You're right...[l][p]
c1_030_0041,Though both of them have fallen prey to her curse.[l][p]
c1_030_0042,That's true. In that case...[l][p]
c1_030_0043,It's quite possible she'll also decide to exact[r]revenge on the person who ran her over.[l][p]
c1_030_0044,Not just possible—she may have already done it[r]last night, just like with Iwai.[l][p]
c1_030_0045,Is there anything else that could've served as[r]a motive?[l][p]
c1_030_0046,That talisman, maybe?[r]The one Yoshimi was looking for.[l][p]
c1_030_0047,Oh! Do you think someone wanted to take it[r]from her?[l][p]
c1_030_0048,Well, the talisman wasn't found on her remains.[r]Nor in her house.[l][p]
c1_030_0049,Hmm... But doesn't a hit-and-run seem like too[r]drastic a measure to go to for a little talisman?[l][p]
c1_030_0050,Then in the end...it might've just been an[r]unfortunate accident after all...[l][p]
c1_030_0051,Yeah... It looks that way.[l][p]
c1_030_0052,Either way, what we need now is a testimony[r]from Michiyo herself.[l][p]
c1_030_0053,With a bit of luck, we may be able to ask her[r]what happened during the crash ourselves![l][p]
c1_030_0054,Yeah... I can't wrap my head around that[r]particular development.[l][p]
c1_030_0055,I still have my doubts that it'll be so easy...[l][p]
c1_030_0056,Either way, we won't be able to do this unless[r]Mio and Yakko turn up.[l][p]
c1_030_0057,I'd rather have 'em come sooner rather than[r]later, but...[l][p]
c1_030_0058,I guess we just have to wait.[r]Shall we head inside?[l][p]
c1_030_0059,All right, then.[l][p]
c1_030_0060,...Boss, I thought we were going to wait for Mio[r]in the school?[l][p]
c1_030_0061,Oh, hey. Erio, I wanted to ask you something.[l][p]
c1_030_0062,Aye, aye, Boss![l][p]
c1_030_0063,Jeez, you're an eager beaver.[r]I haven't even said what it was yet.[l][p]
c1_030_0064,...Right. Well, what is it then? Can't remember[r]what you had for dinner last night?[l][p]
c1_030_0065,Looks like that agent over there is having some[r]trouble with his pen.[l][p]
c1_030_0066,So if you've got a spare, go lend it to him.[l][p]
c1_030_0067,And for the record, I had katsudon last night.[r]No need to worry about me going senile just yet.[l][p]
c1_030_0068,Uh, I know I look like a genius, but I didn't[r]think I came across as the type to carry spare[r]pens on my person.[l][p]
c1_030_0069,You, a genius? You're dreaming.[l][p]
c1_030_0070,But if his pen just stopped working, he can get[r]it going again with a bit of [c4]nail polish remover[c0].[l][p]
c1_030_0071,Nail polish remover...?[l][p]
c1_030_0072,Yeah, you know. What you use to remove nail polish.[r]Never used it before?[l][p]
c1_030_0073,Do I look like I would've...?[l][p]
c1_030_0074,Don't make me sound crazy for not having used[r]the stuff. I doubt you have either.[l][p]
c1_030_0075,Oh, no, I've used it all right! Did you know[r]that it can remove oil-based ink stains?[l][p]
c1_030_0076,Which is also why it can be used to fix old,[r]dried-up pen nibs.[l][p]
c1_030_0077,Whatever's in there that removes the ink also[r]doubles as a way to unclog pens![l][p]
c1_030_0078,Huh. Good to know. Still wouldn't call you a[r]genius, but...it's something.[l][p]
c1_030_0079,You gotta make sure the remover doesn't mix[r]with the ink, though, or it'll ruin it.[l][p]
c1_030_0080,...Doesn't that defeat the purpose?[l][p]
c1_030_0081,Not to worry. I don't have nail polish remover[r]on me right now anyway.[l][p]
c1_030_0082,Oh, no problem, then.[l][p]
c1_030_0083,That doesn't fix anything![l][p]
c1_030_0084,Long story short... I don't have a spare pen![l][p]
c1_030_0085,Jeez. All right, I'll let him know.[l][p]
c1_030_0086,All right, let's go wait inside the school.[l][p]
c1_030_0087,I'm sure they'll be here any moment![l][p]
c1_030_0088,It's nice that we got permission to use the[r]school as our base of operations.[l][p]
c1_030_0089,The principal and head teacher were a little[r]reluctant at first, but they were convinced that[r]it'd help the investigation.[l][p]
c1_030_0090,Dealing with all this must be a real headache[r]for those guys. I should thank 'em again later.[l][p]
c1_030_0091,<i>I guess we still can't rule out the possibility[r]that Michiyo did commit suicide...[l][p]
c1_030_0092,<i>She was so young... And all the adults in her[r]life did was push her around...[l][p]

c1_040_0016,From HQ to all bureaus[l][p]
c1_040_0017,Officers have discovered the residence of paroled[r]offender Fumichika Nejima, currently wanted under[r]suspicion of criminal threat.[l][p]
c1_040_0018,Suspect escaped his residence prior to officers'[r]arrival and is now at large in Sumida City.[l][p]
c1_040_0019,Suspect is thought to be fleeing on foot. All[r]bureaus are instructed to pursue, ensuring that[r]he does not take refuge indoors.[l][p]
c1_040_0020,Furthermore, suspect is believed to possess a[r]weapon capable of causing large-scale casualties.[l][p]
c1_040_0021,All officers are instructed to exercise extreme[r]caution in their pursuit, remaining vigilant for[r]signs of explosives and poison gas.[l][p]

c1_040_0023,Sorry, Boss. I tracked down Nejima's safe house,[r]but he legged it just before we got there.[l][p]
c1_040_0024,Not your fault. We should've known he'd be on[r]the lookout for us.[l][p]
c1_040_0025,We've got officers all over town. It's only a[r]matter of time before we bag him.[l][p]

c1_040_0027,Jun Erio
c1_040_0028,!
c1_040_0029,Think
c1_040_0030,...Oh, I changed my shirt, Boss.[r]No need for a BO check.[l][p]
c1_040_0031,The hell? Why would I be trying to sniff your[r]pit stink?[l][p]
c1_040_0032,Wait... Is that not what you were doing?[l][p]
c1_040_0033,Dunno where you got that idea, but you can put it[r]right back where it came from.[l][p]
c1_040_0034,I'll get you in the mood for a good whiff someday,[r]Boss. I'll stake my career on it![l][p]
c1_040_0035,Hell no. Not even for your career.[l][p]
c1_040_0036,Huh? You sure are eyeing me up, Boss.[r]Don't tell me...you've got a thing for me!?[l][p]
c1_040_0037,No, no, nothin' like that. Sorry.[r]I shouldn't stare.[l][p]
c1_040_0038,So, Boss... What are we doing here anyway?[l][p]
c1_040_0039,I figured Nejima might show up.[l][p]
c1_040_0040,Call it a hunch, but he used this place as a[r]hideout twenty years ago.[l][p]
c1_040_0041,Fair enough. But will he even remember it after[r]so long...?[l][p]
c1_040_0042,Remember that mug shot of Nejima we circulated?[l][p]
c1_040_0043,I think it was from when he got out on parole, but[r]except for a few wrinkles, he looked just like he[r]did twenty years ago.[l][p]
c1_040_0044,Yeah. No idea how he kept up that weight on a[r]prison diet.[l][p]
c1_040_0045,That's a stroke of luck, though, isn't it?[r]It means he'll be easy to spot.[l][p]
c1_040_0046,See, there's something bothering me about that...[l][p]
c1_040_0047,We've got every officer in the area looking for[r]him, but no one's seen a damn thing.[l][p]
c1_040_0048,Which makes me wonder... What if we're looking[r]for the wrong face?[l][p]
c1_040_0049,You mean he's slimmed down? But it's only been[r]half a year since he made parole.[l][p]
c1_040_0050,Could he really have lost that much weight in[r]just six months?[l][p]
c1_040_0051,Well, he must look different enough that no one[r]recognized him when he started working at Komagata High.[l][p]
c1_040_0052,Good point. But that means the photo we've got[r]is useless...[l][p]
c1_040_0053,I know we didn't see anyone when we looked around[r]before, but maybe we should check again.[l][p]
c1_040_0054,Don't bother. It's only been a few minutes.[r]Let's take a second to sit and think.[l][p]
c1_040_0055,Aye, aye, Boss! Break time it is![l][p]
c1_040_0056,The rest of the town's crawling with police, but[r]there's practically no one here.[l][p]
c1_040_0057,We've been running ourselves ragged all day.[r]It's nice to finally stop and catch our breath.[l][p]
c1_040_0058,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori09 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #09[c0] discovered!
c1_040_0059,<i>Damn you, Nejima. Where the hell did you go?[l][p]
c1_040_0060,Huh? Hey, Boss.[l][p]
c1_040_0061,Hm?[l][p]
c1_040_0062,I think I hear something coming from those bushes[r]over there.[l][p]
c1_040_0063,You sure it ain't the wind?[l][p]
c1_040_0064,Hello!? Is anybody there!?[l][p]
c1_040_0065,Well, I'll be damned...[l][p]
c1_040_0066,Hey, you! Lemme ask you something!
c1_040_0067,And how can I help you two fine gents?[l][p]
c1_040_0068,Huh? Do I know you? I could swear I've seen you[r]somewhere before...[l][p]
c1_040_0069,Fraid you ain't gonna charm anyone with that[r]tired old line, sir, not even this old-timer.[l][p]
c1_040_0070,Playing hard to get, eh? My mistake.[l][p]
c1_040_0071,Anyway, what's your business here?[l][p]
c1_040_0072,Just enjoying a moment to myself since I've got[r]the day off. I like it here. It's peaceful.[l][p]
c1_040_0073,We're looking for someone.[r]Mind if we ask you some questions?[l][p]
c1_040_0074,Sounds like a lucky man, sir, to have a strapping[r]gent like yourself after him.[l][p]
c1_040_0075,This one's business, not pleasure. I've dedicated[r]my life to putting this guy behind bars.[l][p]
c1_040_0076,You can say that again! Boss put in so many hours,[r]even his wife and kid left him.[l][p]
c1_040_0077,Enough, Erio. You'll set him off.[l][p]
c1_040_0078,Sorry to hear that, sir. But if you glared at them[r]like that all day, I can't say I blame 'em.[r]Wahahaha![l][p]
c1_040_0079,Oh, that's it. The guy I'm after used to laugh[r]just like that.[l][p]
c1_040_0080,You sure you haven't seen him?[l][p]
c1_040_0081,Oh, no, sir. Don't know anyone like that, sir.[l][p]
c1_040_0082,But with a laugh like that, he must be bad to[r]the bone.[l][p]
c1_040_0083,He's a nasty piece of work, all right. But maybe[r]he can still do the right thing.[l][p]
c1_040_0084,You'd like to think so, eh?[l][p]
c1_040_0085,Erio. Call for backup.[l][p]
c1_040_0086,Huh? You mean...that's him!?[l][p]
c1_040_0087,Crap, he's running away![l][p]
c1_040_0088,Wait![l][p]
c1_040_0089,I'll go after him! You get backup![l][p]
c1_040_0090,Okay! I'm on it![l][p]
c1_040_0091,From HQ to all bureaus[l][p]
c1_040_0092,Suspect has been sighted in the Former Yasuda[r]Gardens and is fleeing towards Komagata Bridge.[l][p]
c1_040_0093,Erio, go the long way round![r]We'll trap him on the bridge![l][p]
c1_040_0094,Got it![l][p]
c1_040_0095,Give it up, Nejima![l][p]
c1_040_0096,You're surrounded! There's no way out![l][p]
c1_040_0097,Hey, now. You're really gonna pull that thing on[r]poor ol' me?[l][p]
c1_040_0098,When did the boys in blue get so trigger-happy[r]around unarmed civilians?[l][p]
c1_040_0099,Unarmed my ass. We know what the curse you're[r]packing is capable of.[l][p]
c1_040_0100,But we also know it can't do shit in daylight.[r]So give it up and come quietly.[l][p]
c1_040_0101,Can't do shit in daylight, eh? What do you think[r]I am, some third-rate amateur?[l][p]
c1_040_0102,I'm a goddamn black magician.[l][p]
c1_040_0103,No way! C-can black magic really do that!?[l][p]
c1_040_0104,Like hell it can. He's pulling that out of[r]his ass.[l][p]
c1_040_0105,Black magic is from the West, and these curses are[r]Japanese. They don't have anything to do with[r]each other.[l][p]
c1_040_0106,Besides, if he could use curses while the sun was[r]up, he wouldn't have given us till dusk.[l][p]
c1_040_0107,Ooh. Nice of you to take me at my word on that.[l][p]
c1_040_0108,Now that Iwai's out of the picture, I'm shit out[r]of options.[l][p]
c1_040_0109,Good to know. Sounds like it won't take much to[r]get you to give up.[l][p]
c1_040_0110,Careful, now. I might just be desperate enough to[r]try something.[l][p]
c1_040_0111,And the kid over there might just be desperate[r]enough to shoot.[l][p]
c1_040_0112,Bit of a wild card, huh?[l][p]
c1_040_0113,Think
c1_040_0114,Fumichika Nejima
c1_040_0115,Ayame Tono
c1_040_0116,Folks are starting to gather. That's no surprise,[r]given the scene we're causing...[l][p]
c1_040_0117,but if Nejima's packing explosives, he won't need[r]a curse to cause a bloodbath.[l][p]
c1_040_0118,These idiots need to get out of here, but they[r]won't listen. Why do rubberneckers always have[r]balls of steel?[l][p]
c1_040_0119,Damn. His hands are starting to shake.[l][p]
c1_040_0120,Being face-to-face with Nejima must be getting[r]to him.[l][p]
c1_040_0121,I have every confidence he won't, but...god, I[r]hope he doesn't crack under pressure and fire.[l][p]
c1_040_0122,All right, let's hope he cools off now that he's[r]lowered his gun. No sudden moves, now...[l][p]
c1_040_0123,...Bet the same thing's going through Erio's head[r]right now.[l][p]
c1_040_0124,Nejima looks nothing at all like I remember him.[l][p]
c1_040_0125,Did he really starve himself skinny just for this?[r]Is he that hellbent on revenge?[l][p]
c1_040_0126,Erio. If he makes any funny moves, shoot him.[l][p]
c1_040_0127,Leave it to me, Boss! I'll get him right between[r]the eyes![l][p]
c1_040_0128,Whoa, whoa! Easy there, hotshot.[l][p]
c1_040_0129,I dunno if you're serious, but think about what[r]you're saying here.[l][p]
c1_040_0130,If I really am unarmed, you'll be all over the[r]news faster than you can say "excessive force."[l][p]
c1_040_0131,My boss'll take the fall, so that's fine by me![l][p]
c1_040_0132,You're shitting me. This guy's a basket case...[l][p]
c1_040_0133,And a damn good officer.[l][p]
c1_040_0134,Fuck me... You've got spirit, kid, I'll give[r]you that.[l][p]
c1_040_0135,Just give yourself up and this'll all be over.[l][p]
c1_040_0136,Hey, Boss? Can I shoot already?[r]My arms are getting tired over here.[l][p]
c1_040_0137,Wha...?[l][p]
c1_040_0138,Knock yourself out.[l][p]
c1_040_0139,Whoa! Hold up! The hell is wrong with you!?[r]You really gonna shoot a guy just 'cause your[r]arms are tired!?[l][p]
c1_040_0140,Fuck, you look like you're really gonna do it![r]You're out of your goddamn minds, both of you![l][p]
c1_040_0141,Hear that, Erio? Let's hold off a little longer.[l][p]
c1_040_0142,Aye, aye, Boss![l][p]
c1_040_0143,Fuck me... The hell are you teaching that kid?[l][p]
c1_040_0144,He's a natural.[l][p]
c1_040_0145,Birds of a feather...[l][p]
c1_040_0146,Don't take your eyes off this guy for a second,[r]Erio.[l][p]
c1_040_0147,Got it.[l][p]
c1_040_0148,They're combing the town for casualties now, but[r]it's going to take a while.[l][p]
c1_040_0149,Ooh. Sounds like you better get to work.[l][p]
c1_040_0150,If you wanna talk, I'll talk, but first you gotta[r]put that thing away.[l][p]
c1_040_0151,I can't think straight with a gun in my face.[l][p]
c1_040_0152,Fine.
c1_040_0153,Not a chance.
c1_040_0154,Fine. Erio, put the gun away.[l][p]
c1_040_0155,...All right.[l][p]
c1_040_0156,But I'm ready to tackle him if he makes any sudden[r]moves![l][p]
c1_040_0157,Be my guest.[l][p]
c1_040_0158,Thank you kindly.[r]I can breathe a little easier now.[l][p]
c1_040_0159,Not a chance. If you've got something to say,[r]then say it.[l][p]
c1_040_0160,Your buddy's hands are shaking. If he squeezes the[r]trigger a bit too hard, I'm done for.[l][p]
c1_040_0161,Makes things more exciting, don't you think?[l][p]
c1_040_0162,You two have lost your fuckin' minds.[l][p]
c1_040_0163,About his threat
c1_040_0164,About his curse
c1_040_0165,About black magic
c1_040_0166,That massacre you told me about on the phone.[r]Did you mean it?[l][p]
c1_040_0167,Every word. Don't you worry. Soon you'll have[r]the case of a lifetime.[l][p]
c1_040_0168,Oh yeah? And how're you gonna pull it off?[l][p]
c1_040_0169,Like I'm gonna tell you, dumbass.[l][p]
c1_040_0170,But I'll give you one thing for free.[l][p]
c1_040_0171,I never had to wait till sundown.[l][p]
c1_040_0172,I just wanted to make sure you'd really hate me[r]for this.[l][p]
c1_040_0173,Pretty sure I hate you plenty already.[l][p]
c1_040_0174,That ain't shit. I need more hatred outta you.[r]More, more, MORE![l][p]
c1_040_0175,Needy son of a bitch, ain'tcha?[l][p]
c1_040_0176,Oh, I'm not done. Just wait till you see what[r]I've got in store for what you really care about.[l][p]
c1_040_0177,You should be quaking in your fucking boots.[l][p]
c1_040_0178,That's not gonna happen![l][p]
c1_040_0179,She's got enough to worry about without your[r]sorry ass getting in her hair.[l][p]
c1_040_0180,Heh. Now that's more like it.[r]There's the face I wanted to see.[l][p]
c1_040_0181,Yeah. Yeah, that's the stuff...[l][p]
c1_040_0182,I'm a man of my word. As you're about to find out.[l][p]
c1_040_0183,You have the curse stone for the One-Sided Reed?[l][p]
c1_040_0184,Course I do. Take a look.[l][p]
c1_040_0185,...That's it, all right.[l][p]
c1_040_0186,Whoops. Better put it somewhere safe.[r]Wouldn't want something to happen to it.[l][p]
c1_040_0187,How did you find out about the curse stones?[r]They don't have anything to do with black magic.[l][p]
c1_040_0188,Someone else turned you onto them, didn't they?[l][p]
c1_040_0189,That puffed-up teacher Araishi couldn't shut up[r]about 'em.[l][p]
c1_040_0190,He's desperate for a chance to flaunt his smarts.[r]All I had to do was act impressed.[l][p]
c1_040_0191,That still doesn't explain how you learned so much[r]so fast.[l][p]
c1_040_0192,Curses and black magic ain't as different as you[r]seem to think.[l][p]
c1_040_0193,Far as I'm concerned, they're just two ways of[r]harnessing paranormal powers.[l][p]
c1_040_0194,You're sure there isn't more to it?[l][p]
c1_040_0195,All that matters is whether that power is the[r]real deal.[l][p]
c1_040_0196,And this curse is very real...as you well know.[l][p]
c1_040_0197,Joke's on you, Nejima. Don't you know the[r]One-Sided Reed is a fake dropped in with the rest?[l][p]
c1_040_0198,Oh, give it a rest. I've tested it myself.[l][p]
c1_040_0199,You used that thing on people? Son of a bitch...[l][p]
c1_040_0200,When something this special falls into your lap,[r]you gotta take it for a spin.[l][p]
c1_040_0201,I'm just good at covering my tracks. Good enough[r]not to get caught, at least.[l][p]
c1_040_0202,Let me guess... You're back to your old tricks?[r]Attacking schoolgirls in the middle of the night?[l][p]
c1_040_0203,Ah... So you know about that, huh.[l][p]
c1_040_0204,One of the brats put up a fight.[l][p]
c1_040_0205,Bought enough time for the other one to get away,[r]so I went ahead and called it quits.[l][p]
c1_040_0206,Sounds like your curse is a real pain to set off.[l][p]
c1_040_0207,Nah, I had that sorted way beforehand, but she[r]pulled some kinda spirit bullshit on me.[l][p]
c1_040_0208,I would've gotten the little bitch eventually...[r]I just didn't have the time.[l][p]
c1_040_0209,Way beforehand, huh? Interesting.[l][p]
c1_040_0210,If you think puzzling out my curse is gonna help,[r]don't bother.[l][p]
c1_040_0211,Why not?[l][p]
c1_040_0212,Because you won't be able to do shit about it[r]either way.[l][p]
c1_040_0213,I'll let you in on a secret.[l][p]
c1_040_0214,I could fuck up a good few hundred people right[r]now if I wanted to.[l][p]
c1_040_0215,A few hundred...?[l][p]
c1_040_0216,Yeah, now you're gettin' it.[r]I could kill any one of 'em at any time.[l][p]
c1_040_0217,Then I guess we've got ourselves a situation.[l][p]
c1_040_0218,You're tellin' me your curse can kill people you[r]can't even see? Seems a bit unfair.[l][p]
c1_040_0219,If you really can do that, why'd you even bother[r]showing up in person last night?[l][p]
c1_040_0220,I wanted to make sure the curse worked.[r]And I figured I'd need to clean up after.[l][p]
c1_040_0221,You've seriously got your curse locked onto[r]several hundred people?[l][p]
c1_040_0222,That's one hell of a curse stone you're packing.[r]These things sure ain't made equal.[l][p]
c1_040_0223,And of course you got the nasty one.[r]Of all the shitty luck...[l][p]
c1_040_0224,Heh. I'm told I pulled a good one.[l][p]
c1_040_0225,Told? By who?[l][p]
c1_040_0226,Whoops! I've said too much.[r]Wahahaha![l][p]
c1_040_0227,I knew it! Someone fed you all this info![l][p]
c1_040_0228,I don't know what you're talking about.[l][p]
c1_040_0229,Fine, then. Keep your mouth shut.[r]But I do know one thing.[l][p]
c1_040_0230,All that about being able to use your curse[r]during the day... It's bullshit. Just a bluff.[l][p]
c1_040_0231,Oh? Is that what you think?[l][p]
c1_040_0232,Your back's to the wall and you still haven't[r]used your curse.[l][p]
c1_040_0233,If you really could pull the plug at any time,[r]you'd have done it by now.[l][p]
c1_040_0234,...[l][p]
c1_040_0235,Wahahaha! Now there's the Tsutsumi I know![l][p]
c1_040_0236,Fine, I admit it. It's exactly like you said.[l][p]
c1_040_0237,If I coulda used my curse, I woulda.[l][p]
c1_040_0238,...So I did.
c1_040_0239,Huh?[l][p]
c1_040_0240,There should be a few new corpses around the city[r]right about now.[l][p]
c1_040_0241,You sure you should be pointing guns at me when[r]people are dying across the city?[l][p]
c1_040_0242,What...? When did you...!?[l][p]
c1_040_0243,Hey! Erio![l][p]
c1_040_0244,Get someone to check that out![r]Just don't take your eyes off Nejima![l][p]
c1_040_0245,Aye, aye, Boss![l][p]
c1_040_0246,Hey! I need someone over here![l][p]
c1_040_0247,Yeah, that's right. Get to earnin' that paycheck.[l][p]
c1_040_0248,If you don't see to 'em soon...there'll be plenty[r]more on the way.[l][p]
c1_040_0249,However will you get out of this mess?[l][p]
c1_040_0250,The longer you keep me here, the more people die.[r]That's blood on your hands.[l][p]
c1_040_0251,Bullshit. You're bluffing.[l][p]
c1_040_0252,Think what you like. You'll see soon enough.[l][p]
c1_040_0253,What's it been, Nejima? Twenty years you've been[r]studying black magic?[l][p]
c1_040_0254,And now you're just giving it all up for Eastern[r]curses? I didn't have you down for a cheater.[l][p]
c1_040_0255,Hey, now. Black magic screwed me over first.[l][p]
c1_040_0256,You can't blame a man for going with the girl who[r]can meet his needs.[l][p]
c1_040_0257,Screwed you over how? Because your resurrection[r]ritual didn't work? That was the real point of[r]the murders, wasn't it?[l][p]
c1_040_0258,...![l][p]
c1_040_0259,Must've been rough, putting in all that work for[r]no payoff.[l][p]
c1_040_0260,Imagine my surprise when I finally found out what[r]you were really after.[l][p]
c1_040_0261,So now you're trying again with the Rite of[r]Resurrection, taking the chance to spit in my eye[r]while you do it.[l][p]
c1_040_0262,...[l][p]
c1_040_0263,Tell me, Nejima.[l][p]
c1_040_0264,Who is it you want to resurrect so damn bad?[l][p]
c1_040_0265,Who is it you've spent twenty years chasing?[l][p]
c1_040_0266,...[l][p]
c1_040_0267,It's the mother of that baby, ain't it?[l][p]
c1_040_0268,...![l][p]
c1_040_0269,You had a partner.[l][p]
c1_040_0270,And though you never put a ring on her...the two[r]of you had a kid.[l][p]
c1_040_0271,But then she died. Maybe she got sick, maybe she[r]got into an accident, but either way, she left[r]you and the kid all alone in the world.[l][p]
c1_040_0272,Tell me I'm wrong, Nejima. It's her you're trying[r]to bring back, isn't it?[l][p]
c1_040_0273,...[l][p]
c1_040_0274,I've seen for myself just how many folks are[r]pinning their hopes on this Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
c1_040_0275,And I can tell you this: it ain't natural, and it[r]ain't gonna lead to anything good.[l][p]
c1_040_0276,So...[l][p]
c1_040_0277,If all you ever needed was someone to help you[r]deal with the pain, then...[l][p]
c1_040_0278,Wahahahahahaha!!![l][p]
c1_040_0279,God, you're so fuckin' stupid![l][p]
c1_040_0280,Huh...?[l][p]
c1_040_0281,Is that really what you think!? That's hilarious.[r]You don't know a goddamn thing![l][p]
c1_040_0282,Wha—!?[l][p]
c1_040_0283,Damn it! For a second there, I really thought[r]you were gonna talk him down, Boss![l][p]
c1_040_0284,Listen up, chump...[l][p]
c1_040_0285,I'll tell you what really happened twenty years[r]ago![l][p]
c1_040_0286,What...really happened?[l][p]
c1_040_0287,You got half of it right.[l][p]
c1_040_0288,I did have a loving girl back once, sweet as[r]could be.[l][p]
c1_040_0289,Shino's what she went by, though I couldn't tell[r]you if that was her real name.[l][p]
c1_040_0290,Dunno where she came from, either. She traveled,[r]I think. Might've been an angel for all I know.[r]She sure seemed like one to me.[l][p]
c1_040_0291,But then she got sick...and just like that, she[r]was gone.[l][p]
c1_040_0292,My guess is that it was the pollution, but I never[r]knew for sure. Couldn't afford a decent doctor.[l][p]
c1_040_0293,My life after that was a living hell...[l][p]
c1_040_0294,Until I found this grimoire in an old bookstore.[l][p]
c1_040_0295,A grimoire, huh?[l][p]
c1_040_0296,It told of a resurrection ritual—black magic that[r]could bring Shino back.[l][p]
c1_040_0297,So I was right.[l][p]
c1_040_0298,Not exactly. See...[l][p]
c1_040_0299,Who said the ritual didn't work?[l][p]
c1_040_0300,You said it yourself. Black magic screwed you[r]over.[l][p]
c1_040_0301,Oh, it screwed me all right.[l][p]
c1_040_0302,But it worked just fine.[l][p]
c1_040_0303,What's that supposed to mean?[l][p]
c1_040_0304,See, the ritual doesn't bring the person back as[r]they were when they died.[l][p]
c1_040_0305,It's more like...reincarnation. Rebirth.[l][p]
c1_040_0306,Rebirth...?[l][p]
c1_040_0307,Wait...[l][p]
c1_040_0308,Oh no. Oh hell no.[l][p]
c1_040_0309,You mean...that baby...!?[l][p]
c1_040_0310,Damn right. The resurrection ritual brought Shino[r]back to me...as a fucking baby.
c1_040_0311,You've gotta be kidding me...[l][p]
c1_040_0312,You're telling me that wasn't her kid?[r]That was her, in the flesh!?[l][p]
c1_040_0313,The hell I am! That little brat was not my Shino![l][p]
c1_040_0314,Her mind was gone! She was totally helpless![r]She didn't even know who I was![l][p]
c1_040_0315,Her warm arms, her gentle voice... Gone, gone,[r]gone! There wasn't a damn thing left of her![l][p]
c1_040_0316,What the hell did you expect!? She was a baby![l][p]
c1_040_0317,If you'd really cared about her, you would've[r]grown some balls and acted like a father![l][p]
c1_040_0318,Fuck that![l][p]
c1_040_0319,I snatched sacrifices off the street for her,[r]chopped them to pieces for her...and that's what[r]I get!?[l][p]
c1_040_0320,A screaming little bundle of shit and piss!?[r]That wasn't my Shino! Give me back her softness![r]Give me back her warmth! Give her back to me![l][p]
c1_040_0321,So you just left the baby to die? I knew you were[r]scum, but... You really are the lowest of the low.[l][p]
c1_040_0322,Look me in the eye and tell me that if your wife[r]turned into a baby, you'd love her just the same![l][p]
c1_040_0323,How could I do that when I couldn't even be sure[r]it was really her!?[l][p]
c1_040_0324,Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get that you're human[r]garbage who doesn't care about anyone but himself.[l][p]
c1_040_0325,So now you're going after the Rite of Resurrection[r]in the hopes you'll get luckier this time.[l][p]
c1_040_0326,Luck doesn't come into it. The Rite really works.[r]There's proof.[l][p]
c1_040_0327,And what happens if you get the same results?[r]If your Shino comes back as a baby again?[l][p]
c1_040_0328,Ghh...![l][p]
c1_040_0329,Shut up! Don't you put that lie in my head![r]It'll work this time, it has to![l][p]
c1_040_0330,Haah... Haah...[r]Fuck![l][p]
c1_040_0331,It doesn't matter. I'm through with black magic.[l][p]
c1_040_0332,Is that why you gave your grimoire to Iwai?[l][p]
c1_040_0333,I figured he could use it. I put a lot of work[r]into getting him to believe that sorta stuff.[l][p]
c1_040_0334,<i>I doubt he can pull off what he's threatening,[r]but we can't be too cautious here...[l][p]
c1_040_0335,<i>And if we try to take him down by force, things[r]could get sticky.[l][p]
c1_040_0336,<i>If I keep him talking, maybe I can get him to drop[r]his guard, or even talk him down. I just have to[r]be careful not to provoke him...[l][p]
c1_040_0337,<i>Best-case scenario is we get him in cuffs.[r]Next best is we steal his curse stone.[l][p]
c1_040_0338,<i>Either way, I need to get some idea of how his[r]curse works, or I'll be flying blind.[l][p]
c1_040_0339,<i>No way he's used his curse. He's gotta be blowing[r]smoke up our asses! But if he's not...[l][p]
c1_040_0340,<i>What's his game here? Is he just stalling for[r]time? Or does he have some way to turn the tables?[l][p]
c1_040_0341,All righty then.[l][p]
c1_040_0342,Huh...?[l][p]
c1_040_0343,GRAAAAAAAAAH!!!
c1_040_0344,I'll slit your throat, you little shit![l][p]
c1_040_0345,Huh!? Wha...whaaaaaa!?[r]S-stay back! I'll shoot!
c1_040_0346,Wait, stop! Don't actually shoot, you idiot![l][p]
c1_040_0347,See ya around, dumbfucks!
c1_040_0348,Shit! He jumped![l][p]
c1_040_0349,Damn it... After him! Don't let him get away![l][p]
c1_040_0350,Huh? What the...!?
c1_040_0351,<i>Whoa... Back up, back up, back up! The hell is[r]she doing here!?[l][p]
c1_040_0352,<i>Crap! Our eyes just met![l][p]
c1_040_0353,<i>This is bad! Real bad! Why'd she have to pick[r]now of all times!?[l][p]
c1_040_0354,<i>Grrr... Get out of here, damn it! Book it before[r]he sees you![l][p]
c1_040_0355,<i>Agh, but I need to ask her about Namigaki! Shit![l][p]
c1_040_0356,Boss!? Where are you doing, looking all over the[r]place!? Focus![l][p]
c1_040_0357,Hah![l][p]
c1_040_0358,Damn it...![l][p]
c1_040_0359,Fuck, he's fast! Ayame! Get away![l][p]
c1_040_0360,Ah...![l][p]
c1_040_0361,Well, well, well! Ayame Tono! I've been looking[r]for you for a very long time![l][p]
c1_040_0362,Huh!? Wha...[r]D-Dad...![l][p]
c1_040_0363,Ayame! Don't you dare, you bastard![r]Get away from her![l][p]
c1_040_0364,Get over here![l][p]
c1_040_0365,Aaah![l][p]
c1_040_0366,Get off! You're hurting me![l][p]
c1_040_0367,Ah-ah-ah! Stay right where you are or she dies![l][p]
c1_040_0368,Hey! Get back here![l][p]
c1_040_0369,Make me! See ya around, dumbfucks![l][p]
c1_040_0370,Whoa![l][p]
c1_040_0371,That piece of shit took Ayame hostage and ran[r]off with her![l][p]
c1_040_0372,After him! We can't let him get away![l][p]
c1_040_0373,From HQ to all bureaus[l][p]
c1_040_0374,Suspect has evaded capture at Komagata Bridge and[r]remains at large.[l][p]
c1_040_0375,He is currently on the run with one female hostage.[l][p]
c1_040_0376,I gotta say, Boss...[l][p]
c1_040_0377,We really screwed that one up.[l][p]
c1_040_0378,Yeah. Yeah, we did.[l][p]
c1_040_0379,It's my fault. All we can do now is hope he[r]doesn't slip the net.[l][p]
c1_040_0380,We know his identity now, Boss. He can't run[r]forever.[l][p]
c1_040_0381,C'mon, keep your chin up. I'm sure the hostage[r]will be all right.[l][p]
c1_040_0382,I hope so...[l][p]
c1_040_0383,I can't believe that was your daughter.[r]How crazy is that?[l][p]
c1_040_0384,Yeah.[l][p]
c1_040_0385,We've been trying to get a hold of her since this[r]morning, and she just shows up there?[l][p]
c1_040_0386,Who woulda thought... What a twist of fate.[l][p]
c1_040_0387,Yeah. A bit too twisted of a twist for my liking.[l][p]
c1_040_0388,I think you need a breather, Boss.[r]You're not making sense.[l][p]
c1_040_0389,Does this mean she was the one in the car with[r]Namigaki?[l][p]
c1_040_0390,...Nah, we don't know that yet.[l][p]
c1_040_0391,Let's see what she has to say...before we...[r]jump to any...conclusions...[l][p]
c1_040_0392,You sound tired, Boss. That standoff must've[r]really done a number on you.[l][p]
c1_040_0393,...[l][p]
c1_040_0394,C'mon, let's treat ourselves to some mitsumame.[r]That'll put a spring in your step!
c1_040_0395,Yeah... That sounds good.[l][p]
c1_040_0396,Some sugar might be just what I need to get my[r]brain working.
c1_040_0397,Whoa! Hold on, Boss! Sounds like patrol's just[r]gotten a message! I'll go check it out![l][p]
c1_040_0398,Sure thing.[l][p]
c1_040_0399,Please be good news... Please be good news...![l][p]
c1_040_0400,Good news, Boss! They've found Nejima!
c1_040_0401,No shit! What about the hostage?[l][p]
c1_040_0402,I dunno. They just said to come quick.[l][p]
c1_040_0403,Damn it. Guess we'll find out when we get there...[l][p]
c1_040_0404,At 4:28 p.m., Fumichika Nejima, also known as[r]Makoto Ashimiya...
c1_040_0405,was discovered in the Former Yasuda Gardens,[r]beaten to death.
c1_040_0406,The body suffered 110 distinct instances of blunt[r]force trauma. The case is being treated as a[r]homicide.
c1_040_0407,The deceased's possessions have not been recovered[r]and appear to have been taken post-mortem.
c1_040_0408,The location of the deceased's female hostage[r]remains unclear. Police continue to pursue her as[r]a person of interest.

c1_045_0006,From HQ to all bureaus[l][p]
c1_045_0007,Suspect evaded officers at Komagata Bridge and[r]fled, and currently remains at large.[l][p]
c1_045_0008,The time at which he threatened to carry out his[r]attack is approaching.[l][p]
c1_045_0009,In response, we will call in reinforcements and[r]widen the search perimeter beyond the immediate[r]Sumida River area.[l][p]
c1_045_0010,...Boss.[l][p]
c1_045_0011,Aaah, Boss! Boss![l][p]
c1_045_0012,Boss, I'm sorry... It's all my fault![l][p]
c1_045_0013,If only I hadn't lost my nerve and opened fire...[l][p]
c1_045_0014,Enough. I told you already; it's on me.[r]I should've told you to lower your weapon.[l][p]
c1_045_0015,Thinking that chasing him to the river would[r]corner him was also a miscalculation.[l][p]
c1_045_0016,Sure, it's possible that right now...[l][p]
c1_045_0017,he's sleeping with the fishes at the bottom[r]of the river...[l][p]
c1_045_0018,but somehow I doubt things would be that easy.[l][p]
c1_045_0019,Do you think...he really can kill hundreds of[r]people...?[l][p]
c1_045_0020,Who knows. Him saying he already used his curse[r]turned out to be a bluff.[l][p]
c1_045_0021,Hard to believe he could kill hundreds at once,[r]even with a curse stone, but...[l][p]
c1_045_0022,All we can do is pray that he was lying.[l][p]
c1_045_0023,The condition for Nejima's curse stone,[r]the One-Sided Reed, was only later discovered:
c1_045_0024,Kills by dismemberment one whose face, address,[r]name, age, occupation, and location are all known[r]by the curse bearer.
c1_045_0025,And so, at sunset that day...
c1_045_0026,Out of 632 students enrolled at Komagata High[r]School, the 377 who were at home...
c1_045_0027,each had one arm and one leg severed. One by one,[r]in the order they appeared in the school register,[r]they bled to death while screaming in agony.
c1_045_0028,Having no known cause, this atrocity terrified[r]the public, resulting in widespread panic.
c1_045_0029,Before long, fear and speculation plunged society[r]into total chaos, and misinformation about the[r]curses began to spread...
c1_045_0030,A series of unrelated incidents broke out,[r]unleashing pandemonium beyond all control.
c1_045_0031,While it is uncertain whether Fumichika Nejima[r]intended things to go this far...
c1_045_0032,Tetsuo Tsutsumi's daughter, Ayame Tono, was also[r]killed by Nejima's curse shortly after...
c1_045_0033,and Tetsuo Tsutsumi, unable to bear the heavy[r]responsibility or the people's blame, quit the[r]police force and fled from the public eye.
c1_045_0034,At the very least, Nejima's goal of driving[r]Tetsuo Tsutsumi to ruin could not have been more[r]thoroughly achieved.
c1_045_0035,Thus, with his rapturous satisfaction,[r]the curtains close on...

c1_050_0015,...Hey.[l][p]
c1_050_0016,How long has it been since we saw each other,[r]three years? How've you been?[l][p]
c1_050_0017,I think the last time was when you came to see me[r]after deciding to go to university...[l][p]
c1_050_0018,That wasn't because I wanted to see you.[r]I just needed money to pay my tuition.[l][p]
c1_050_0019,Hah. Not one to mince words, eh.[l][p]
c1_050_0020,...You came alone, right?[l][p]
c1_050_0021,Yeah... It's just me.[l][p]
c1_050_0022,You make it sound like I'm handing over ransom[r]money for hostages.[l][p]
c1_050_0023,I just don't want to get caught, okay?[l][p]
c1_050_0024,Never thought I'd see the day that you called[r]the police...[l][p]
c1_050_0025,There's something I needed to see you about.[l][p]
c1_050_0026,Well... All right, then.[l][p]
c1_050_0027,We've got a lot to talk about, so let's go through[r]things one by one.[l][p]
c1_050_0028,Bushes
c1_050_0029,Talk
c1_050_0030,Ayame Tono
c1_050_0031,Think
c1_050_0032,She sure has changed over the past three years.[r]Got more of a grown-up air about her...[l][p]
c1_050_0033,Hard to believe she's that same little girl who[r]would get omelet all over her face when we took[r]her out to eat...[l][p]
c1_050_0034,Wait a minute! Is that how far back I have to go[r]for a happy memory together!?[l][p]
c1_050_0035,No wonder she hates me...[l][p]
c1_050_0036,Huh? What was that?[r]Did something just move over there...?[l][p]
c1_050_0037,...Guh! What the hell are those idiots doing!?[l][p]
c1_050_0038,I told them not to come... Damn it![l][p]
c1_050_0039,Shit... I don't wanna know what'll happen if they[r]get found out. Whatever I do, I gotta keep from[r]looking over there![l][p]
c1_050_0040,Don't look that way! Don't do it! Absolutely not![l][p]
c1_050_0041,About her curse stone
c1_050_0042,About the talisman
c1_050_0043,About why she wants the Rite
c1_050_0044,About being taken hostage
c1_050_0045,About Fumichika Nejima
c1_050_0046,About her mother
c1_050_0047,You...have a curse stone, don't you?[l][p]
c1_050_0048,...I do.[l][p]
c1_050_0049,You wouldn't happen to feel like handing it over,[r]would ya?[l][p]
c1_050_0050,The police will handle any damages the curse[r]caused. Now, before you do any more wrong[r]with it...[l][p]
c1_050_0051,I'm not giving it up.[l][p]
c1_050_0052,Course not...[l][p]
c1_050_0053,Me being a curse bearer... Are you after my life?[l][p]
c1_050_0054,That's exactly what I'm here for.[r]I didn't come to chat.[l][p]
c1_050_0055,We can talk all you want, but as soon as the[r]condition for my curse is met...[l][p]
c1_050_0056,I'll use it, no hesitation.[l][p]
c1_050_0057,...[l][p]
c1_050_0058,Or...do you have more than one?[r]How many curse stones do you have?[l][p]
c1_050_0059,...[l][p]
c1_050_0060,Three... Not that it matters.[l][p]
c1_050_0061,Three, huh...[l][p]
c1_050_0062,...I'm not handing them over.[l][p]
c1_050_0063,Can I ask you one thing?[l][p]
c1_050_0064,Do you know anything about the talisman Michiyo[r]Shiraishi had?[l][p]
c1_050_0065,Michiyo...Shiraishi...?[l][p]
c1_050_0066,From the car crash you were in with that[r]Namigaki guy.[l][p]
c1_050_0067,Oh, with Yutaro? Yeah, it was there.[l][p]
c1_050_0068,Yutaro...!?[l][p]
c1_050_0069,That...sounds like...[l][p]
c1_050_0070,So you...you and him were... I mean...[l][p]
c1_050_0071,Eh... Not really.[l][p]
c1_050_0072,He was kind of a boring guy.[l][p]
c1_050_0073,What!? You're serious!?[r]But he said...[l][p]
c1_050_0074,Aaah, you're getting off track, Mr. Tsutsumi.[r]The talisman! Get back to the talisman![l][p]
c1_050_0075,We shouldn't have relied on him for this...[l][p]
c1_050_0076,Well, if you don't plan on seeing him again,[r]it doesn't matter...[l][p]
c1_050_0077,But...with the hit-and-run case on top of[r]everything, you're really in deep...[l][p]
c1_050_0078,Is that really what you wanted to talk about?[l][p]
c1_050_0079,Yeah... I mean, no![r]Tell me about the talisman![l][p]
c1_050_0080,Did you take it from the scene?[l][p]
c1_050_0081,...[l][p]
c1_050_0082,...You mean this?[l][p]
c1_050_0083,That's it...![l][p]
c1_050_0084,I picked it up at the scene of the crash...[r]I didn't want to leave fingerprints behind.[l][p]
c1_050_0085,...That's all? There's really no other reason?[l][p]
c1_050_0086,What's the big deal...? Is it really that special?[r]This ol' thing?[l][p]
c1_050_0087,Yeah...it's real important.[r]Would you mind giving it to me?[l][p]
c1_050_0088,Important? For what?[l][p]
c1_050_0089,For putting a stop to the curses of the[r]Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
c1_050_0090,Oh...[l][p]
c1_050_0091,So...that means if I give you the talisman,[r]I won't be able to use the Rite.[l][p]
c1_050_0092,Then no way. I'm definitely keeping it.[l][p]
c1_050_0093,Urgh... I screwed that one up...[l][p]
c1_050_0094,Mr. Tsutsumi...[r]You really can't do any better than that?[l][p]
c1_050_0095,Come on... The talisman...[l][p]
c1_050_0096,Will you...give me the talisman?[l][p]
c1_050_0097,What? No way. I can't lose the Rite.[l][p]
c1_050_0098,Why are you willing to go so far for the Rite of[r]Resurrection? What do you want with it?[l][p]
c1_050_0099,Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.[l][p]
c1_050_0100,You'd just call it stupid and dismiss the idea[r]completely.[l][p]
c1_050_0101,C'mon, I wouldn't do that.[l][p]
c1_050_0102,Maybe together we can think up a way for you to[r]get what you want without resurrection...[l][p]
c1_050_0103,I want to bring Katsushika Hokusai back to life.[l][p]
c1_050_0104,Ho...Hokusai...?[l][p]
c1_050_0105,What? Hokusai the ukiyo-e artist? That Hokusai?[r]You want to bring him back to life...?[l][p]
c1_050_0106,That'd be quite the feat, huh?[l][p]
c1_050_0107,That's...! You...! I heard you liked his art,[r]but...why would you do something so stupid...!?[l][p]
c1_050_0108,...See?[l][p]
c1_050_0109,Gah...[l][p]
c1_050_0110,The only time I ever felt there was a place I[r]belonged was when I was immersed in the dreamlike[r]world of ukiyo-e![l][p]
c1_050_0111,Though I'm sure you never noticed.[l][p]
c1_050_0112,Really... I had no idea...[l][p]
c1_050_0113,...It saved me.[l][p]
c1_050_0114,Hokusai is the reason I'm still alive today.[l][p]
c1_050_0115,I didn't know you felt so hopeless...[l][p]
c1_050_0116,You would only realize it now. But it's too late.[r]Feeling sorry won't do either of us any good.[l][p]
c1_050_0117,From the moment I heard about the Rite of[r]Resurrection, I knew that was my destiny.[l][p]
c1_050_0118,If this is all I ever accomplish, I'll die happy.[l][p]
c1_050_0119,You're really serious about this...[l][p]
c1_050_0120,Then I'll put this bluntly.[l][p]
c1_050_0121,Did you kill Nejima?[l][p]
c1_050_0122,...[l][p]
c1_050_0123,...And if I did?[l][p]
c1_050_0124,Would you hide me from the police?[l][p]
c1_050_0125,Hrk...[l][p]
c1_050_0126,Well, I... I don't know if I...[l][p]
c1_050_0127,That's what I thought. Your job is the only[r]thing you really care about.[l][p]
c1_050_0128,...Yes. I did it.[l][p]
c1_050_0129,You...[l][p]
c1_050_0130,I don't think he even knew I was a curse bearer.[l][p]
c1_050_0131,He brought me to those gardens, and I realized[r]while he was talking to me that he fulfilled the[r]condition of my curse...so I just gave it a shot.[l][p]
c1_050_0132,I didn't think it would actually activate...[l][p]
c1_050_0133,...[l][p]
c1_050_0134,So...there's no going back now.[l][p]
c1_050_0135,That's not true! You can still make things right—[r]before you make them worse![l][p]
c1_050_0136,Then let me say it another way.[l][p]
c1_050_0137,This is my chance, and I won't throw it away.[l][p]
c1_050_0138,Your chance...?[l][p]
c1_050_0139,Did Nejima...say anything to you?[l][p]
c1_050_0140,He said a lot of bad things about you, that's[r]for sure.[l][p]
c1_050_0141,Yeah... Not surprised there.[l][p]
c1_050_0142,So I said a lot of bad things about you back.[r]I didn't want to be outdone.[l][p]
c1_050_0143,Harsh.[l][p]
c1_050_0144,In that sense, I felt...just a little...like he[r]was my kindred spirit.[l][p]
c1_050_0145,No, no, no! Kindred spirit? What are you talking[r]about!? He's a dangerous criminal![l][p]
c1_050_0146,But I'm a murderer now too, aren't I?[r]Maybe we're not so different...[l][p]
c1_050_0147,Hrk...![l][p]
c1_050_0148,No... You're... You're different...![l][p]
c1_050_0149,...Am I?[l][p]
c1_050_0150,...Well, maybe not that different.[l][p]
c1_050_0151,...But at least you're honest.[l][p]
c1_050_0152,...[l][p]
c1_050_0153,I...know I haven't been the best father.[l][p]
c1_050_0154,But I wonder...of all the fathers in the world...[l][p]
c1_050_0155,...?[l][p]
c1_050_0156,Are there any who wouldn't cover for their child[r]if they'd committed a crime?[l][p]
c1_050_0157,How should I know?[l][p]
c1_050_0158,You're the detective here.[r]You must've seen plenty of cases like that.[l][p]
c1_050_0159,...[l][p]
c1_050_0160,Yeah... Plenty of parents take the fall for their[r]children, or give them a place to hide.[l][p]
c1_050_0161,As a person, it's wrong, but maybe...as a parent...[r]it's the right thing to do?[l][p]
c1_050_0162,I don't know.[l][p]
c1_050_0163,But I think having a father like that would make[r]it easier to go to him for advice if I did do[r]something wrong.[l][p]
c1_050_0164,Maybe there's a sense of security in knowing that[r]no matter what happened, you'd have at least one[r]person on your side.[l][p]
c1_050_0165,I see... So that's what it would take...[r]to be on your side.[l][p]
c1_050_0166,I...can't do that.[l][p]
c1_050_0167,...[l][p]
c1_050_0168,That's okay. I wasn't really expecting you to.[l][p]
c1_050_0169,So Nejima really didn't tell you anything?[l][p]
c1_050_0170,...[l][p]
c1_050_0171,Not really, no.[l][p]
c1_050_0172,...How is she? Yasuko, I mean.[l][p]
c1_050_0173,Mom? ...I haven't kept in touch with her.[l][p]
c1_050_0174,I've been on my own this whole time.[l][p]
c1_050_0175,I'm sure you've reached out to her, though,[r]haven't you?[l][p]
c1_050_0176,...I did call her this morning, actually.[r]Just to make sure she was safe.[l][p]
c1_050_0177,She's been running around all over the place[r]looking for you.[l][p]
c1_050_0178,Hmph. Sounds like she's fine to me.[l][p]
c1_050_0179,Did you contact her after I called the police to[r]tell her you'd heard from me?[l][p]
c1_050_0180,I...did not.[l][p]
c1_050_0181,Tsk tsk.[l][p]
c1_050_0182,Well, I've heard you're into nightlife and[r]staying out late these days... Didn't want her[r]to worry more than she already was.[l][p]
c1_050_0183,You're one to talk.[l][p]
c1_050_0184,I'm sorry I couldn't save you from Nejima.[r]...Are you hurt?[l][p]
c1_050_0185,Wow. I didn't expect that from you.[l][p]
c1_050_0186,Huh...?[l][p]
c1_050_0187,I thought you'd just start questioning me before[r]you bothered to ask how I'm doing.[l][p]
c1_050_0188,Ah...[l][p]
c1_050_0189,Well...I am still your father.[l][p]
c1_050_0190,Oooh, maybe Boss can handle this after all![l][p]
c1_050_0191,...And there it is. That's so like you.[l][p]
c1_050_0192,What?[l][p]
c1_050_0193,You're only mentioning that now? Shouldn't that[r]have been the first thing you asked me?[l][p]
c1_050_0194,Urk...![r]Well...I was just...[l][p]
c1_050_0195,You're not worried about me.[r]All you care about is yourself.[l][p]
c1_050_0196,...Yeah. You're right.[r]I've been selfish, I know.[l][p]
c1_050_0197,Aww, come on, Mr. Tsutsumi...[r]You can do better than that.[l][p]
c1_050_0198,He really screwed up there, huh...[l][p]
c1_050_0199,I'm fine. I managed to get away, somehow[r]or other.[l][p]
c1_050_0200,...Right. I'm glad.[l][p]
c1_050_0201,The sun is starting to dip down into the horizon.[r]This long, long day is about to end.[l][p]
c1_050_0202,We don't have to worry about Nejima's threat[r]anymore, but I sure didn't expect this to happen.[l][p]
c1_050_0203,<i>She called the police asking for me by name and[r]demanded that I come meet her here alone.[l][p]
c1_050_0204,<i>They asked if I wanted a team to set up a[r]perimeter, but I had them stand down.[l][p]
c1_050_0205,<i>Sure, she might make a run for it...but I don't[r]want her panicking if she has a curse stone.[r]Besides, I'm not trying to take her in by force.[l][p]
c1_050_0206,I think I've let you talk enough.[l][p]
c1_050_0207,Mind letting me have a turn?[l][p]
c1_050_0208,...By all means.[l][p]
c1_050_0209,You're hiding something.[l][p]
c1_050_0210,You're hiding something from me, aren't you?[l][p]
c1_050_0211,...![l][p]
c1_050_0212,I am.
c1_050_0213,I'm not.
c1_050_0214,Well, sure... You can't live as long as I have[r]without having a secret or two.[l][p]
c1_050_0215,Of course you'd try to dodge the question.[l][p]
c1_050_0216,...I'm not.[l][p]
c1_050_0217,Wow. That's a bold declaration.[l][p]
c1_050_0218,Now, then...[l][p]
c1_050_0219,Let me tell you how my curse stone, the Taiko[r]of Tsugaru, works.[l][p]
c1_050_0220,What!?[l][p]
c1_050_0221,My curse...bludgeons to death anyone I find out[r]is hiding something from me.[l][p]
c1_050_0222,...![l][p]
c1_050_0223,So if you try to cover something up that I know[r]is true, I'll be able to use my curse on you.[l][p]
c1_050_0224,With that in mind... Can I ask you one more thing?[l][p]
c1_050_0225,Ah, I get it. Why you wanted to see me.[l][p]
c1_050_0226,Then let me tell you one thing first.[l][p]
c1_050_0227,...?[l][p]
c1_050_0228,The Evergreen Beech has a similar condition.[l][p]
c1_050_0229,I can use my curse on anyone who tells me a lie.[l][p]
c1_050_0230,What!?[l][p]
c1_050_0231,How is that fair...[r]And you'd use that curse on me?[l][p]
c1_050_0232,As an officer of the law, it's inexcusable...[r]But as a parent with a duty to his child, I have[r]no other choice.[l][p]
c1_050_0233,Are you...threatening me? Do you really think[r]that's enough to convince me to do as you say?[l][p]
c1_050_0234,I don't want to use it either. But for your sake,[r]I suggest you try not to lie.[l][p]
c1_050_0235,...Go ahead, then. If I lie, then so be it.[l][p]
c1_050_0236,Okay, I'm gonna ask.[l][p]
c1_050_0237,If you try to hide it now, you really will die.[l][p]
c1_050_0238,Am I...[l][p]
c1_050_0239,Am I...your real daughter?[l][p]
c1_050_0240,...[l][p]
c1_050_0241,I'm just a baby you picked up to replace your[r]stillborn, aren't I?[l][p]
c1_050_0242,And you could never bring yourself to tell me who[r]my real parents were, so you just kept hiding it.[l][p]
c1_050_0243,...[l][p]
c1_050_0244,Still too much of a coward to tell me, huh?[l][p]
c1_050_0245,You don't like the truth, so you won't admit it.[l][p]
c1_050_0246,That my real parent...is the man I was just with...[l][p]
c1_050_0247,Ayame![l][p]
c1_050_0248,Is that all you have to say?[l][p]
c1_050_0249,Then I only have one answer for you.[l][p]
c1_050_0250,You are...honestly and truly...our daughter.[l][p]
c1_050_0251,Nothing more, nothing less.[l][p]
c1_050_0252,E-even now...you're still trying to hide it!?[l][p]
c1_050_0253,Why!? Are you really that stupid!?[l][p]
c1_050_0254,GAAAAAAHHH![l][p]
c1_050_0255,[s0]Urgh!
c1_050_0256,[s0]Graaah!
c1_050_0257,Aaah...![r]Boss! Boss!!![l][p]
c1_050_0258,Why...? Is your pride worth dying for...!?[l][p]
c1_050_0259,[s0]Ngah...!
c1_050_0260,[s0]Urgh!
c1_050_0261,[s0]Gaaah!
c1_050_0262,[s0]Agh!
c1_050_0263,[s0]Ngh!
c1_050_0264,[s0]Graaagh!
c1_050_0265,[s0]Aaaaaagh!
c1_050_0266,...[l][p]
c1_050_0267,Haah... I should've known.[l][p]
c1_050_0268,Why...[l][p]
c1_050_0269,Why go this far to hide it?[l][p]
c1_050_0270,[s0.1]Ayame... Listen...[l][p]
c1_050_0271,Huh!?[l][p]
c1_050_0272,You're... How...?[l][p]
c1_050_0273,...Ayame...[l][p]
c1_050_0274,Be proud. No matter what happens, you are...[r]our precious daughter...![l][p]
c1_050_0275,No way... How are you still alive...!?[l][p]
c1_050_0276,I don't know what that piece of shit Nejima[r]filled your head with...[l][p]
c1_050_0277,But you're not...Shino...[l][p]
c1_050_0278,And you're not Ashino, either...[l][p]
c1_050_0279,You're our daughter, Ayame Tsutsumi...[l][p]
c1_050_0280,...[l][p]
c1_050_0281,...Ah, right...I guess it's Tono now.[r]...Well, that's fine, too.[l][p]
c1_050_0282,Tsutsumi... Tono...[r]Both will always be part of who you are.[l][p]
c1_050_0283,...[l][p]
c1_050_0284,Wh-what...? Why are you doing this...?[l][p]
c1_050_0285,That's not true... The curse proves that it's not.[l][p]
c1_050_0286,Sure...you probably don't have many memories of[r]us playing together...[l][p]
c1_050_0287,And I did leave everything at home to your mom...[r]And I was barely ever there for you...[l][p]
c1_050_0288,...[l][p]
c1_050_0289,Even so...when I was working...no matter how[r]grisly a crime scene I was at...[l][p]
c1_050_0290,All I ever wanted was for you to grow up to be[r]happy... That's it.[l][p]
c1_050_0291,Why...why say all of this now...?[l][p]
c1_050_0292,So...do one last thing for me.[l][p]
c1_050_0293,I want you...to tell me the truth, too.[l][p]
c1_050_0294,And if you lie to me now...I'm taking you with me.[l][p]
c1_050_0295,Stop, I can't...[l][p]
c1_050_0296,The mastermind behind all this...the one who[r]awakened the curses of the Seven Mysteries in[r]order to use the Rite...[l][p]
c1_050_0297,wasn't you...was it?[l][p]
c1_050_0298,No... No.[r]I wouldn't even know how to do that...[l][p]
c1_050_0299,And picking up Michiyo Shiraishi's talisman...[l][p]
c1_050_0300,was just coincidence, right?[l][p]
c1_050_0301,...Huh? Yeah, I already told you that.[l][p]
c1_050_0302,Ah... Good...[l][p]
c1_050_0303,Hearing that...I can rest easy.[l][p]
c1_050_0304,...You're nothing like Nejima.[l][p]
c1_050_0305,You can stand on your own two legs...you can keep[r]living...without escaping into a fantasy.[l][p]
c1_050_0306,You can hate me...[r]You can dream all the crazy dreams you want...[l][p]
c1_050_0307,Just...don't ever stop trying to do good.[l][p]
c1_050_0308,You're a victim of your curse, too..[l][p]
c1_050_0309,...[l][p]
c1_050_0310,It's not too late to atone...for the hit-and-run...[r]for using the curse... Don't run away.[l][p]
c1_050_0311,You can still make things right.[l][p]
c1_050_0312,I know you can. Because you're my daughter.[l][p]
c1_050_0313,And after that...[r]Just live the best life...that you can...
c1_050_0314,Dad...![l][p]
c1_050_0315,Aaah... Aaaaaah![l][p]
c1_050_0316,...Boss! Booooooss!!![l][p]
c1_050_0317,That day, at 6:18 p.m., Ayame Tono was taken[r]into custody.[l][p]
c1_050_0318,Tetsuo Tsutsumi's death was confirmed[r]at the same time.[l][p]
c1_050_0319,The five curse stones possessed by Tsutsumi,[r]as well as the three given up by Ayame, lost their[r]curse bearers. This temporarily extinguished their[r]spirit power, allowing Mio Kurosuzu to obtain them[r]and seal them away without difficulty.[l][p]
c1_050_0320,The [c3]Yin Talisman[c0] possessed by Ayame Tono was[r]recovered and entrusted to Mio Kurosuzu as well.[l][p]
c1_050_0321,Thus, any massacre that could potentially be[r]caused by this iteration of the curses was[r]prevented before it could ever happen.[l][p]
c1_050_0322,...Or so it seemed.

c1_050_0324,<color=#ddd><font="TELOP"><cspace=-4px><voffset=-0.5em>8 p.m.
c1_050_0325,Sorry for keeping you out so late, Mio.[l][p]
c1_050_0326,I can't take my mind off the curse bearer who was[r]never found.[l][p]
c1_050_0327,Oh, it's no problem for me. I usually work at[r]night anyway.[l][p]
c1_050_0328,Did you see Yakko home safely?[l][p]
c1_050_0329,Yep. We sent her home in a patrol car earlier.[l][p]
c1_050_0330,Apparently she put up quite a fuss, saying she[r]wanted to see things through to the end...[l][p]
c1_050_0331,Thank you. The Feast of Shadows was starting to[r]take effect, so it would have been dangerous...[l][p]
c1_050_0332,Mio Kurosuzu
c1_050_0333,!
c1_050_0334,...Oh.[l][p]
c1_050_0335,Hm?[l][p]
c1_050_0336,What's wrong?[l][p]
c1_050_0337,Next is...Detective Erio...?[l][p]
c1_050_0338,What...?[l][p]
c1_050_0339,It's like she noticed something just from looking[r]at me...[l][p]
c1_050_0340,Having a girl like her react to me as if she's[r]seen something significant is kinda terrifying...[l][p]
c1_050_0341,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori20 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #20[c0] discovered!
c1_050_0342,I can't get my mind off the remaining curse stone,[r]the Whispering Canal...and who the mastermind is.[l][p]
c1_050_0343,But we have to deal with that thing before I can[r]worry about any of that.[l][p]
c1_050_0344,How's it going with the two talismans? Have you[r]figured out the location of the Record of Fates[r]Yin Scroll?[l][p]
c1_050_0345,I have. More or less.[l][p]
c1_050_0346,When I combined the contents of the two talismans,[r]they formed a seal which could be undone.[l][p]
c1_050_0347,The things inside the talismans that looked like[r]scraps of wood were actually a tiny scroll kept[r]folded up by the seal.[l][p]
c1_050_0348,Who'd have thought the talismans actually[r]contained the scroll itself...[l][p]
c1_050_0349,So that's the Yin Scroll, then. What's it say?[l][p]
c1_050_0350,Well, there's one more seal we have to undo to[r]open the scroll.[l][p]
c1_050_0351,It's giving me some trouble, so I was actually[r]hoping you could help me out.[l][p]
c1_050_0352,Okay, unlocking the seal, got it. Sure thing![l][p]
c1_050_0353,I dunno what I'll be able to do, but let me at it![l][p]
c1_050_0354,Wow, I didn't expect you to be so eager to help.[r]It's oddly reassuring...[l][p]
c1_050_0355,Okay, let's see...[l][p]
c1_050_0356,There are [c3]five seals[c0] holding the scroll shut.[l][p]
c1_050_0357,I think we have to remove them in the [c3]correct[r]order[c0].[l][p]
c1_050_0358,Each seal has a different design: [c3]a carp, a[r]light, a beech leaf, a taiko drum, and a reed[c0]...[l][p]
c1_050_0359,Remove the five seals in the right order... Okay.[l][p]
c1_050_0360,If we get it wrong, is it going to...you know...[r]go boom?[l][p]
c1_050_0361,Huh? No. We'll just have to try again.[r]I tested it once already.[l][p]
c1_050_0362,Oh... You already tried it yourself? So brave![l][p]
c1_050_0363,I think it's devised so the seal can only be[r]undone if the curses for the Rite have already[r]been unleashed.[l][p]
c1_050_0364,And I think there's a hint to opening it hidden[r]in something related to the curses...[l][p]
c1_050_0365,Hmm...[l][p]
c1_050_0366,Just let me know when you're ready.[l][p]
c1_050_0367,Remove the seals
c1_050_0368,Consult with Mio
c1_050_0369,It won't explode or anything, so we might as[r]well give it a try.[l][p]
c1_050_0370,I see... Okay![l][p]
c1_050_0371,Do you [c3]recognize[c0] any of the things on these seals?[r]They look sort of familiar...[l][p]
c1_050_0372,Maybe there'd be something in our files.[l][p]
c1_050_0373,I see... Okay![l][p]
c1_050_0374,Oh... The seals look like some of [c3]the curse[r]stones' designs[c0].[l][p]
c1_050_0375,That must mean there's some order to the Seven[r]Mysteries of Honjo that correspond to them...[l][p]
c1_050_0376,I see... Okay![l][p]
c1_050_0377,The seal was applied during the Edo period, so it[r]probably has to do with [c3]events that took place[r]around then[c0]...[l][p]
c1_050_0378,I see... Okay![l][p]
c1_050_0379,I'll look up the resentful memories for the[r]Mysteries that correspond to the five seals...[l][p]
c1_050_0380,These are fragments of the dying moments of those[r]who became the curse echoes.[l][p]
c1_050_0381,Reading closely, doesn't it feel like there's a[r][c3]connection[c0] between them...?[l][p]
c1_050_0382,I see... Okay![l][p]
c1_050_0383,Hmm, I'm starting to notice something.[l][p]
c1_050_0384,I think that the order for the seals could be[r][c3]the order in which the people who became curse[r]echoes died[c0].[l][p]
c1_050_0385,The information in the resentful memories are only[r]fragments, but we might be able to see their[r]relative order.[l][p]
c1_050_0386,Would that make the old man from the Taiko of[r]Tsugaru the first...?[l][p]
c1_050_0387,I see... Okay![l][p]
c1_050_0388,[s0][a0.5][x0.7]Remove the five seals in the [c3]correct order[c0].
c1_050_0389,The Carp Seal
c1_050_0390,[c2]The Carp Seal
c1_050_0391,The Light Seal
c1_050_0392,[c2]The Light Seal
c1_050_0393,The Beech Leaf Seal
c1_050_0394,[c2]The Beech Leaf Seal
c1_050_0395,The Taiko Drum Seal
c1_050_0396,[c2]The Taiko Drum Seal
c1_050_0397,The Reed Seal
c1_050_0398,[c2]The Reed Seal
c1_050_0399,Hmm... I don't think that was right...[l][p]
c1_050_0400,Nope, no good...[l][p]
c1_050_0401,Wow, you got it right! It's open![l][p]
c1_050_0402,Getting it on the first try, that's amazing![r]You're a real pro![l][p]
c1_050_0403,Heheh. Nothing to it, really.[r]Told ya you could leave it to me![l][p]
c1_050_0404,Getting it in just [$64] tries, that's great![r]Nice job![l][p]
c1_050_0405,It was easier than I thought.[r]I just looked at which event followed which.[l][p]
c1_050_0406,It took [$64] tries, but you did it.[l][p]
c1_050_0407,I just needed some time to get warmed up,[r]that's all...[l][p]
c1_050_0408,At long last, after [$64] attempts you finally[r]figured it out...[l][p]
c1_050_0409,I realized that since there are only 120 possible[r]combinations, I was bound to get it eventually![l][p]
c1_050_0410,Now, we can finally read what's written inside.[r]Let's see...[l][p]
c1_050_0411,8 p.m. With no one around, this place is silent[r]as the grave.[l][p]
c1_050_0412,No one wants to go out at night in these parts[r]after everything that's happened over the past[r]two days.[l][p]
c1_050_0413,<i>So much has happened this evening, but it's[r]still not over...[l][p]
c1_050_0414,<i>We haven't found the curse bearer of the[r]Whispering Canal...[l][p]
c1_050_0415,<i>And we still have to put a stop to these curses...[l][p]
c1_050_0416,<i>Guess it makes sense for such an important[r]document to be sealed so tight...[l][p]
c1_050_0417,<i>It might help to talk things over with Mio[r]if I get stuck.[l][p]
c1_050_0418,Hmm, I see...[l][p]
c1_050_0419,What does it say?[l][p]
c1_050_0420,First is a detailed account of the tragedy[r]surrounding the Rite of Resurrection that[r]occurred in Honjo back in the Edo period.[l][p]
c1_050_0421,The whole story of what we call the Honjo Incident[r]is laid out clearly.[l][p]
c1_050_0422,That incident was the origin of the Seven[r]Mysteries of Honjo and their curses, right?[l][p]
c1_050_0423,Yes. The resentment of the victims of the incident[r]turned into curses, which are the curse echoes.[l][p]
c1_050_0424,The contents are organized like an answer sheet,[r]so it doesn't just give us the information we need.[l][p]
c1_050_0425,Ah...[l][p]
c1_050_0426,Is there anything else?[l][p]
c1_050_0427,Yes. Here's what we've been looking for.[l][p]
c1_050_0428,[c3]"I bequeath this scroll to future generations[r]to be used in the event that calamity should[r]arise from this grievous incident,"[c0] it says.[l][p]
c1_050_0429,Whoa... He foresaw all of this happening...[l][p]
c1_050_0430,And it continues...[l][p]
c1_050_0431,[s0.04][a0.5]Those who seek to forestall disaster must gather[r]these [c3]three items[c0] in one place to cast my Rite of[r]Cleansing and expel all rituals and curses in full.
c1_050_0432,[s0.04][a0.5]My [c3]soul[c0]...that is, my [c3]curse echo[c0].[r]My [c3]body[c0]...that is, a living continuation of my [c3]bloodline[c0].[r]My [c3]mind[c0]...that is, my own [c3]consciousness[c0].
c1_050_0433,Wow... So if we gather these [c3]three things[c0] in[r]one place...[l][p]
c1_050_0434,Seiman's [c3]Rite of Cleansing[c0] will activate and[r]completely negate the curses and the Rite of[r]Resurrection![l][p]
c1_050_0435,Oooh, that's it! That's exactly what we need![l][p]
c1_050_0436,The three things are Seiman's soul, body,[r]and mind...[l][p]
c1_050_0437,It says the soul is Seiman's curse echo...[l][p]
c1_050_0438,His curse echo...? So Seiman himself is part of[r]the Seven Mysteries...?[l][p]
c1_050_0439,Now that you mention it, Mr. Araishi said[r]something along those lines before.[l][p]
c1_050_0440,There's another hint written here.[l][p]
c1_050_0441,[c3]"My curse echo holds my curse.[r]My curse brings ruin to curse bearers."[c0][l][p]
c1_050_0442,What kind of hint is that? Maybe it'll make more[r]sense as we keep looking...[l][p]
c1_050_0443,But...will the curse echo still appear if the[r]curse bearer is already gone?[l][p]
c1_050_0444,Next, the body is a descendant of Seiman's,[r]it seems.[l][p]
c1_050_0445,Wasn't [c4]Yoshimi[c0] a relative of Seiman...?[l][p]
c1_050_0446,He and [c4]Michiyo Shiraishi[c0], who had the other[r]talisman...[l][p]
c1_050_0447,Agh... Both of them had already passed by the[r]time this iteration of the curses was unleashed...[l][p]
c1_050_0448,Damn, that's true... What are we gonna do...!?[l][p]
c1_050_0449,His bloodline was so split up... There have to[r]be others.[l][p]
c1_050_0450,...Oh, there's another note here, too.[l][p]
c1_050_0451,Where? Is it another hint?[l][p]
c1_050_0452,[s0.04][a0.5]"As for the body... Seek not only one who bears my[r]blood, but [c3]one with strong spirit sense[c0]."[c0][l][p]
c1_050_0453,[s0.04][a0.5]"Such an individual will be able, if a spirit[r]attempts to possess them, to instead [c3]take control[r]of that spirit[c0] themselves."[l][p]
c1_050_0454,...So it says.[l][p]
c1_050_0455,Do we know of anyone like that...?[l][p]
c1_050_0456,I can't think of anyone...[l][p]
c1_050_0457,Let's move on for now.[l][p]
c1_050_0458,Next is the mind...[l][p]
c1_050_0459,What's the difference between the mind and[r]the soul...?[l][p]
c1_050_0460,Um... In paranormal theory, it's said that humans[r]are made up of soul, body, and mind.[l][p]
c1_050_0461,The mind is essentially thought to be the part of[r]the spirit that makes up one's consciousness,[r]or one's self.[l][p]
c1_050_0462,It's like driving. The body is the car, the soul[r]is the control system, and...[l][p]
c1_050_0463,the mind is the driver.[l][p]
c1_050_0464,Hmm, I see... I think that makes sense.[l][p]
c1_050_0465,...So is there a hint for finding this one, too?[l][p]
c1_050_0466,Well, let's see...[l][p]
c1_050_0467,There's this: [c3]"Should the Rite of Resurrection[r]be activated elsewhere, so too shall my mind be[r]awakened there."[c0][l][p]
c1_050_0468,Seiman tried to seal away the Rite of[r]Resurrection...[l][p]
c1_050_0469,But before he could, Ashino stole the Record[r]of Fates.[l][p]
c1_050_0470,So as a countermeasure to the Rite being[r]activated...[l][p]
c1_050_0471,he made it so that his mind would be released[r]from the seal.[l][p]
c1_050_0472,Okay, but...what does that actually mean?[l][p]
c1_050_0473,What it means is...[l][p]
c1_050_0474,...Seiman's mind awoke the night the Rite was[r]activated, and must be [c3]possessing someone out[r]there[c0] right now...[l][p]
c1_050_0475,What...!?[l][p]
c1_050_0476,So we have to get that person together with[r]everything else.[l][p]
c1_050_0477,All right! So we have to find the curse echo,[r]the descendant, and the person possessed by Seiman.[l][p]
c1_050_0478,Then we just get them together in one place and[r]we'll be good to go![l][p]
c1_050_0479,Right. But there is one thing...[l][p]
c1_050_0480,The second and third ones could both be the[r]same person.[l][p]
c1_050_0481,Oooh...[l][p]
c1_050_0482,But who could that be...?[l][p]
c1_050_0483,If it's like how Michiyo lost her memories when[r]she was possessing Yakko...[l][p]
c1_050_0484,...Seiman's consciousness [c3]might not be aware of[r]who it really is[c0]...[l][p]
c1_050_0485,So if he learned the truth, would he start to act[r]of his own accord?[l][p]
c1_050_0486,Oh...? Then...that person could already be...?[l][p]
c1_050_0487,...Oh, hold on a second.[r]Someone's coming this way...[l][p]
c1_050_0488,Huh...?[l][p]
c1_050_0489,Excuse me! Could I interrupt for just a moment?[l][p]
c1_050_0490,Um... Who might you be?[l][p]
c1_050_0491,Would you buy this empty can of juice I just[r]finished drinking for 10,000 yen?[l][p]
c1_050_0492,Huh...?[l][p]
c1_050_0493,I'll even throw in these bones from some fried[r]chicken. You can't beat a deal like this![l][p]
c1_050_0494,Um... I, uh... I don't really want them...[l][p]
c1_050_0495,Don't say that! Come on, they're delicious![l][p]
c1_050_0496,Actually, I thought I might just have a picnic[r]right here! Won't you join me!?[l][p]
c1_050_0497,Sorry...um...[l][p]
c1_050_0498,I don't understand... What should we do?[l][p]
c1_050_0499,Well, it's not like we need this exact spot, and[r]we can't do anything with other people around.[r]Let's just move somewhere else...[l][p]
c1_050_0500,Um, sorry. We're in the middle of something, so[r]we'll just be on our way...[l][p]
c1_050_0501,Wha...!?[r]...Urgh![l][p]
c1_050_0502,Ngah...! Hng...guh...[r]It...hurts...[l][p]
c1_050_0503,Urgh...ngh...[r]This...is a curse...[l][p]
c1_050_0504,You have my heartfelt thanks for all your hard[r]work thus far.[l][p]
c1_050_0505,This brings the story of the Seven Mysteries of[r]Honjo to a close.[l][p]
c1_050_0506,And who could have foreseen such a conclusion...?[l][p]
c1_050_0507,Unfortunately, it seems the so-called mastermind[r]was one step ahead of you.[l][p]
c1_050_0508,She remains hidden, leaving behind no evidence...[r]Perhaps there is truly no way to stop her.[l][p]
c1_050_0509,However, should you find that this conclusion[r]is not to your liking...[l][p]
c1_050_0510,by all means, please pursue a different path.[l][p]
c1_050_0511,You have done it once before, so I am sure you[r]already know how.[l][p]
c1_050_0512,With that, I shall be taking my leave.[l][p]
c1_050_0513,I have been your humble Storyteller.[r]Good night.[l][p]

d1_010_0015,Oh! Good morning, Yakko.[l][p]
d1_010_0016,Huh...?[l][p]
d1_010_0017,Yakko? Rise and shiiine.[l][p]
d1_010_0018,Ngh... Huh?[l][p]
d1_010_0019,You're up![l][p]
d1_010_0020,Huh? It's morning?[r]Um, I...[l][p]
d1_010_0021,Are you okay? Can you remember your name?[l][p]
d1_010_0022,Uh... Duh, I'm—
d1_010_0023,Yakko Sakazaki.
d1_010_0024,Michiyo Shiraishi.
d1_010_0025,Mio Kurosuzu.
d1_010_0026,The Specter of the Spirit Board.
d1_010_0027,...Yes! I'm Yakko Sakazaki![l][p]
d1_010_0028,Good. Seems like you're fully awake.[l][p]
d1_010_0029,Um... I'm Michiyo Shiraishi?[l][p]
d1_010_0030,Oh... You must still be half-asleep.[l][p]
d1_010_0031,Up and at 'em, Yakko![l][p]
d1_010_0032,...Yes! I'm Yakko Sakazaki![l][p]
d1_010_0033,Good.[l][p]
d1_010_0034,...Mio Kurosuzu.[r]That's your name, isn't it?[l][p]
d1_010_0035,Um... Right. I actually asked what your name was.[l][p]
d1_010_0036,But it looks like you're awake now,[r]so good enough.[l][p]
d1_010_0037,Yes... I am... the Specter... of the Spirit Board...[l][p]
d1_010_0038,No, no, don't fall back asleep![r]You must still be dreaming. Wake up![l][p]
d1_010_0039,...Yes! I'm Yakko Sakazaki![l][p]
d1_010_0040,Good.[l][p]
d1_010_0041,Oh... Mio. Thanks for last night. Was everything[r]okay?[l][p]
d1_010_0042,Yep. Still alive.[l][p]
d1_010_0043,I couldn't dispel the curse echo or learn the[r]identity of who used it, but I managed to at least[r]get away.[l][p]
d1_010_0044,But in that situation, it's the best you can[r]hope for.[l][p]
d1_010_0045,I'm sorry I got you involved in something so[r]dangerous.[l][p]
d1_010_0046,I meant to look for you as soon as the sun rose,[r]but I was just so sleepy.[l][p]
d1_010_0047,I can't even remember when I fell asleep.[l][p]
d1_010_0048,It's okay. It's only natural to be exhausted after[r]what you went through.[l][p]
d1_010_0049,Besides, I also feel bad that you've been wrapped[r]up in all of this.[l][p]
d1_010_0050,It's supposed to be my job to prevent that from[r]happening.[l][p]
d1_010_0051,Oh yeah, you said something about that last night.[l][p]
d1_010_0052,Just who are you exactly, Mio?[l][p]
d1_010_0053,Oh, well, um...[l][p]
d1_010_0054,The truth is, I've been trained in things having[r]to do with the supernatural.[l][p]
d1_010_0055,Huh? You mean you can learn that kind of stuff[r]like you would with flower arranging?[l][p]
d1_010_0056,I...had quite the eventful childhood.[l][p]
d1_010_0057,Huh... That sounds like it must have been tough.[l][p]
d1_010_0058,Yes... It would take a long time to explain,[r]so let's leave it at that for now.[l][p]
d1_010_0059,As fate would have it, I've ended up as the[r]apprentice, or maybe more like assistant,[r]to a notable paranormal expert.[l][p]
d1_010_0060,Schools have always had more paranormal[r]disturbances because young people tend to be more[r]susceptible to these things.[l][p]
d1_010_0061,I'm sent to schools that may experience[r]something paranormal and put a stop to it before[r]it happens.[l][p]
d1_010_0062,Wow, that's amazing.[r]So it's like a part-time job you do while also[r]being a student?[l][p]
d1_010_0063,Well... I do help maintain public order, but it's[r]all part of my training so I don't get any money...[l][p]
d1_010_0064,Oh... You've got it rough, then.[r]But still, that really is amazing.[l][p]
d1_010_0065,You were so cool when you faced off against the[r]evil spirit![l][p]
d1_010_0066,I never know if I should be happy when you[r]compliment me like that...[l][p]
d1_010_0067,But anyways, that's why it's up to me to resolve[r]any paranormal issues at the school.[l][p]
d1_010_0068,And why I'm going to look into the cause of all[r]this.[l][p]
d1_010_0069,But for now, let's head to school.[l][p]
d1_010_0070,Yeah...[l][p]
d1_010_0071,Oh, do you have your curse stone?[l][p]
d1_010_0072,Now that it's daytime and its power is diminished,[r]I should be able to hold onto it. Want to give[r]it a try?[l][p]
d1_010_0073,Right.[r]I do have it, but...[l][p]
d1_010_0074,...[l][p]
d1_010_0075,Yakko...[l][p]
d1_010_0076,Is it really so wrong? Trying to bring Michiyo[r]back, I mean.[l][p]
d1_010_0077,...[l][p]
d1_010_0078,I...can't approve of it.[l][p]
d1_010_0079,The Rite may seem like a dream come true, but[r]if it involves taking the lives of other people,[r]then...[l][p]
d1_010_0080,Yeah, true...[l][p]
d1_010_0081,I want to make sure this whole ritual ends without[r]anyone getting hurt.[l][p]
d1_010_0082,That's what I believe, and what I'll put before[r]anything else.[l][p]
d1_010_0083,...[l][p]
d1_010_0084,I'm sorry, but... Is it okay if I hold onto it?[l][p]
d1_010_0085,Yakko...[l][p]
d1_010_0086,I promise I won't use the curse, no matter what.[r]But maybe there's some other way...[l][p]
d1_010_0087,I just have this feeling that I shouldn't give up[r]on the possibility just yet. That said, I'll help[r]you. Even if it's to stop the curses.[l][p]
d1_010_0088,For the Michiyo that still exists within me,[r]I'll settle things so that we can move forward![l][p]
d1_010_0089,...[l][p]
d1_010_0090,Okay. But if you ever feel in danger, you can give me[r]the curse stone at any point.[l][p]
d1_010_0091,Right! Thank you, Mio![l][p]
d1_010_0092,Okay then, let's go.[l][p]
d1_010_0093,<align="center"><color=#ddd><cspace=-4px><font="TELOP">駒形高校正門前[x0.3][r]<cspace=0px><font="MAIN">Komagata High School, Front Gates
d1_010_0094,Huh...?[l][p]
d1_010_0095,I thought it unusually noisy.[r]There's a big group of people and police in front[r]of the school.[l][p]
d1_010_0096,Did something happen?[l][p]
d1_010_0097,If the police are here, then something must've.[l][p]
d1_010_0098,I'll go ask.[l][p]
d1_010_0099,Thanks.[l][p]
d1_010_0100,This isn't good...[l][p]
d1_010_0101,Huh? What happened!?[l][p]
d1_010_0102,Um... Don't panic, okay?[l][p]
d1_010_0103,The first teacher who came to work[r]this morning found something.[l][p]
d1_010_0104,O-okay...[l][p]
d1_010_0105,[c3]Mr. Jonouchi[c0] was found dead in the middle of[r]the school grounds.
d1_010_0106,Wh-what!?[l][p]
d1_010_0107,They're closing the school for today.[l][p]
d1_010_0108,But that's not all.[l][p]
d1_010_0109,I didn't know this either since I didn't[r]watch the morning news, but...[l][p]
d1_010_0110,Rumors are spreading that a number of [c3]bodies[c0][r]were found nearby.[l][p]
d1_010_0111,What!? Th-there's no way![l][p]
d1_010_0112,Why!?[r]C-could it be...[l][p]
d1_010_0113,Because of the curse?[l][p]
d1_010_0114,We don't know enough to say.[l][p]
d1_010_0115,From what I heard, Mr. Jonouchi's body was in the[r]middle of the grounds.[l][p]
d1_010_0116,But his body was covered in bruises, like he'd[r]fallen from somewhere high.[l][p]
d1_010_0117,Weird...[l][p]
d1_010_0118,Taking into account his unnatural death and[r]the timing, it's very likely it has something[r]to do with the curse.[l][p]
d1_010_0119,You're saying someone used their curse on him[r]last night?[l][p]
d1_010_0120,Seems like it, doesn't it?[l][p]
d1_010_0121,But that's so scary![l][p]
d1_010_0122,Yeesh... So the curses really do kill people...[l][p]
d1_010_0123,And someone used it![l][p]
d1_010_0124,Shhh...[r]Keep your voice down, okay?[l][p]
d1_010_0125,What would happen if another curse bearer heard[r]you?[l][p]
d1_010_0126,Eep! Sorry...[l][p]
d1_010_0127,I wish we had a little more information, but[r]they've locked up the front gate.[l][p]
d1_010_0128,Maybe we could sneak in[r]through the back entrance...[l][p]
d1_010_0129,Hm...?[l][p]
d1_010_0130,That person over there...[l][p]
d1_010_0131,Isn't that Hitomi Okuda?[l][p]
d1_010_0132,You're right... That's unusual.[l][p]
d1_010_0133,Oh, but she was at the school last night too.[l][p]
d1_010_0134,She must know something about Mr. Jonouchi.[r]Let's see what she has to say.[l][p]
d1_010_0135,Oh! Mio, wait for me![l][p]
d1_010_0136,Huh.[l][p]
d1_010_0137,So you're tellin' me the two of you were[r]the ones at the school last night?[l][p]
d1_010_0138,No sense hidin' it then.[l][p]
d1_010_0139,...Plus, I owe you one, Mio.[r]I'll tell you everything I know.[l][p]
d1_010_0140,Thank you.[l][p]
d1_010_0141,She owes you?[l][p]
d1_010_0142,Oh, um, yeah. Right after I transferred here,[r]there was a bit of trouble.[l][p]
d1_010_0143,She gave me one those, uh... What was it?[r]Oh, exorcisms.[l][p]
d1_010_0144,Huh... So that's what it was.[l][p]
d1_010_0145,Jonouchi's death
d1_010_0146,Mio's exorcism
d1_010_0147,The classroom last night
d1_010_0148,Jonouchi's misdeeds
d1_010_0149,The dirt on Michiyo
d1_010_0150,Did...you hear about Mr. Jonouchi?[l][p]
d1_010_0151,Heard about it?[r]I've known about it since last night.[l][p]
d1_010_0152,I saw that asshole bite it on the school grounds[r]myself.
d1_010_0153,What!? You saw it happen?[l][p]
d1_010_0154,Tell us about it.[r]What happened exactly?[l][p]
d1_010_0155,Don't really know myself. It was pitch black.[l][p]
d1_010_0156,What I can tell you...[l][p]
d1_010_0157,It was almost dawn. Probably around three.[l][p]
d1_010_0158,He started freaking out all of a sudden,[r]ran out on to the ground like somethin' was[r]chasing him. Then screamed—[l][p]
d1_010_0159,[s0][a0.5]"Aaagh! Somebody help me![r]Forgive me, [c3]Michiyo[c0]!"
d1_010_0160,—or something like that while he was runnin'[r]around.[l][p]
d1_010_0161,M-Michiyo!?[r]He mentioned Michiyo?[l][p]
d1_010_0162,Was there anyone else out on the grounds?[l][p]
d1_010_0163,It was too dark to see from where I was.[l][p]
d1_010_0164,But for just a second I think I saw [c3]a girl in[r]a school uniform with her hair in braids[c0].[l][p]
d1_010_0165,Oh?[l][p]
d1_010_0166,I didn't go out to make sure, so it could have[r]been nothing for all I know.[l][p]
d1_010_0167,Then I heard him beggin' for his life like[r]"I was wrong!" and "I'll do anything!"[l][p]
d1_010_0168,Then all of a sudden his arms and legs snapped.[r]Even though he was just standing there.[l][p]
d1_010_0169,His arms and legs broke without[r]anything being done to him?[l][p]
d1_010_0170,He fell over and quit movin' so I thought I[r]better get out of there.[l][p]
d1_010_0171,Then he croaked.[r]That's all I saw.[l][p]
d1_010_0172,I see...[l][p]
d1_010_0173,B-but, from what you've told us...[l][p]
d1_010_0174,It almost sounds like Michiyo's ghost chased down[r]Mr. Jonouchi and killed him![l][p]
d1_010_0175,Hell if I know anything about that.[r]I'm just tellin' you what I heard him say.[l][p]
d1_010_0176,...[l][p]
d1_010_0177,Did you tell that story to the police?[l][p]
d1_010_0178,Nope, and I ain't gonna.[r]Can't count on them for shit.[l][p]
d1_010_0179,Not like they'd believe such an insane story[r]anyways.[l][p]
d1_010_0180,Right...[l][p]
d1_010_0181,But there must be at least one person[r]in the police worth trusting, right?[l][p]
d1_010_0182,...[l][p]
d1_010_0183,Yeah, I guess. There was this one cop who always[r]got on my case about stuff.[l][p]
d1_010_0184,But he died just the other day.[l][p]
d1_010_0185,Oh, he did?[l][p]
d1_010_0186,I'm sorry to hear that...[l][p]
d1_010_0187,Everyone who gets involved with me ends up dead.[l][p]
d1_010_0188,Maybe I really am cursed.[r]Pisses me off.[l][p]
d1_010_0189,You've got it all wrong![l][p]
d1_010_0190,The spirit that possessed you wasn't that kind of[r]spirit.[l][p]
d1_010_0191,Huh? It wasn't?[l][p]
d1_010_0192,Yeah. This was just an unfortunate coincidence.[l][p]
d1_010_0193,Though I'm sure that was hard enough for you.[l][p]
d1_010_0194,...[l][p]
d1_010_0195,That's all I know about that asshole's death.[l][p]
d1_010_0196,Hey, Mio.[r]I've been thinking something.[l][p]
d1_010_0197,Hm?[l][p]
d1_010_0198,The way she described it reminded me of something.[l][p]
d1_010_0199,The way Mr. Jonouchi died...[r]It sounds a lot like how Michiyo died.[l][p]
d1_010_0200,...![l][p]
d1_010_0201,Of course, I didn't see it myself, but...[l][p]
d1_010_0202,The state Michiyo's body was in, it was like she[r]had fallen from high up.[l][p]
d1_010_0203,Could they have been killed by the same curse?[l][p]
d1_010_0204,I don't think so... The curses of the Seven[r]Mysteries hadn't manifested when she died.[l][p]
d1_010_0205,And if we can trust what the spirit board said,[r]then Michiyo died in an accident.[l][p]
d1_010_0206,Oh... Right...[l][p]
d1_010_0207,What you described does sound like[r]Michiyo killed Mr. Jonouchi.[l][p]
d1_010_0208,She did have a reason to hate him, after all...[l][p]
d1_010_0209,No way... You mean that really was[r]her ghost? Like, for real?[l][p]
d1_010_0210,Those who die bearing strong resentment[r]or regret can occasionally become spirits, either[r]bound to a place or roaming freely.[l][p]
d1_010_0211,However, it'd usually be impossible for them[r]to kill the living. Most don't have that kind of[r]power.[l][p]
d1_010_0212,But it's possible they could possess someone[r]close to them to act on those lingering regrets.[l][p]
d1_010_0213,Huh. Wonder if that's what happened.[l][p]
d1_010_0214,All right, then supposing what the spirit board[r]said is true and Michiyo's death was an accident...[l][p]
d1_010_0215,Then she must have had some regrets.[l][p]
d1_010_0216,If she really hadn't given up on living, that is.[l][p]
d1_010_0217,I don't think she was the kind of girl who[r]would just give up no matter what the situation.[l][p]
d1_010_0218,I don't really know, but...[r]She didn't seem like she had something tormenting[r]her so much that she'd kill herself.[l][p]
d1_010_0219,Hmm...[l][p]
d1_010_0220,Perhaps their deaths are connected...[l][p]
d1_010_0221,Hitomi, were you possessed by some kind of[r]evil spirit?[l][p]
d1_010_0222,I don't understand it all too well myself.[r]What I can say for sure is—[l][p]
d1_010_0223,Thanks to Mio, the weird symptoms[r]that were happenin' to me all went away.[l][p]
d1_010_0224,Yep. Some people are born with a natural sensitivity[r]to the paranormal.[l][p]
d1_010_0225,They tend to end up isolated, as they struggle to[r]relate to the people around them.[l][p]
d1_010_0226,They also tend to draw spirits to them naturally.[l][p]
d1_010_0227,This can cause strange symptoms they don't[r]understand like headaches, muscle stiffness, and[r]hallucinations. Even memory problems.[l][p]
d1_010_0228,I'm sure it must have been very hard...[l][p]
d1_010_0229,So that's how it works, huh.[l][p]
d1_010_0230,Do people also have their personality[r]taken over when possessed too?[l][p]
d1_010_0231,Mm. It is possible with spirits who have a[r]very close relationship to their target,[r]like siblings or a parent and child.[l][p]
d1_010_0232,But you almost never hear about people being taken[r]over completely.[l][p]
d1_010_0233,It's when the two parties aren't in sync that[r]those negative effects can start to appear.[l][p]
d1_010_0234,So the séances or whatever you see on TV[r]are all bogus?[l][p]
d1_010_0235,Not quite. There are mediums and diviners who[r]can align their minds with the spirits they call.[l][p]
d1_010_0236,Though there are people on TV who are just putting[r]on a performance...[l][p]
d1_010_0237,Huh...[l][p]
d1_010_0238,There are people who in life had extremely[r]powerful spirit sense, or a deep connection with[r]the person.[l][p]
d1_010_0239,But even they shouldn't be able to completely take[r]over the person they possess.[l][p]
d1_010_0240,And even if they could...[l][p]
d1_010_0241,It'd only be enough to pressure them to choose[r]certain behaviors that wouldn't be unusual for[r]them to do on their own to begin with.[l][p]
d1_010_0242,Hmm.[r]But if that's the case...[l][p]
d1_010_0243,Wouldn't you not know if you were choosing[r]that behavior of your own will or not?[l][p]
d1_010_0244,Hence why there are lots of cases where people[r]don't even realize they're possessed.[l][p]
d1_010_0245,Though the spirit may influence the behavior[r]and memories of the host.[l][p]
d1_010_0246,The deeper their connection in life,[r]the easier it is for that to occur.[l][p]
d1_010_0247,I see... Getting possessed by a spirit[r]is pretty complicated, huh.[l][p]
d1_010_0248,It must have been tough for you being[r]possessed for so long, Hitomi.[l][p]
d1_010_0249,Hmph. Whatever might happen to me[r]doesn't make any difference.[l][p]
d1_010_0250,Me bein' able to see spirits and stuff has[r]nothin' to do with how things ended up like this.[l][p]
d1_010_0251,Yeah... It's not like being able to see them[r]is your fault, either.[l][p]
d1_010_0252,The same goes for me. Maybe it's just something[r]we have to live with.[l][p]
d1_010_0253,I think you have a knack for it yourself, Yakko.[r]I bet you could see them too with a little training.[l][p]
d1_010_0254,Uh... I think I may pass.[l][p]
d1_010_0255,So that's why you do the job you do, huh, Mio?[l][p]
d1_010_0256,I thought she was a weirdo when she showed up[r]all of a sudden saying she was gonna exorcise me.[l][p]
d1_010_0257,If you hadn't said anything I probably woulda[r]knocked your lights out.[l][p]
d1_010_0258,You tried to perform an exorcism on her without[r]telling her anything...?[l][p]
d1_010_0259,Er, you see, in my experience most people[r]don't understand no matter how much I explain...[l][p]
d1_010_0260,They only accept my explanation[r]after they see the results.[l][p]
d1_010_0261,Huh... I guess that makes sense.[l][p]
d1_010_0262,Hitomi. Last night, before you witnessed[r]Mr. Jonouchi collapse...[l][p]
d1_010_0263,Can I ask what he and you were doing[r]in the classroom?[l][p]
d1_010_0264,...[l][p]
d1_010_0265,You gonna tell the cops?[l][p]
d1_010_0266,Oh... Right, with everything that happened with[r]Mr. Jonouchi...[l][p]
d1_010_0267,They'll suspect you if we told them we saw you[r]with him that night.[l][p]
d1_010_0268,Anytime something happens with someone like me[r]all those shitty adults start jumping to[r]conclusions.[l][p]
d1_010_0269,I understand. I won't tell them. You wouldn't[r]have been able to kill him anyway.[l][p]
d1_010_0270,...[l][p]
d1_010_0271,If you say so, then I don't mind tellin'[r]you about it.[l][p]
d1_010_0272,So last night...[l][p]
d1_010_0273,That piece of shit Jonouchi called me[r]over here, acting like he was gonna attack me or[r]something.
d1_010_0274,What...!? How terrible![l][p]
d1_010_0275,Whatever. I'm glad he's dead. He had it comin'.[l][p]
d1_010_0276,Calling people worthless and a cancer on society[r]when he doesn't know shit about them.[l][p]
d1_010_0277,That asshole was the one always[r][c3]acting like scum[c0] if you ask me.[l][p]
d1_010_0278,Is that so...[l][p]
d1_010_0279,Could you tell us in more detail why he[r]called you out in the middle of the night?[l][p]
d1_010_0280,Mmm... It's hard to explain. Where to start...[l][p]
d1_010_0281,So, last night. How did it start...[r]Ah, right.[l][p]
d1_010_0282,Remember that nosy cop I mentioned[r]who was always on my case?[l][p]
d1_010_0283,He died at the Former Yasuda Gardens a couple[r]days ago. [c4]Yoshimi[c0] was his name. He was part of[r]the Juvenile Division.[l][p]
d1_010_0284,He didn't look like a cop at all—real rough[r]guy, but good at lookin' out for folks,[r]so he was the only one I could talk to.[l][p]
d1_010_0285,Huh, so there was someone like that[r]with the police.[l][p]
d1_010_0286,Too bad he ended up dying.[l][p]
d1_010_0287,Oh, another thing, one time he suddenly[r]introduced his fiancée to me.[l][p]
d1_010_0288,It was hilarious seein' a big guy like that act[r]like a shy little kid all of a sudden.[l][p]
d1_010_0289,She told me that she was like me when she was[r]my age and that she was on my side...[l][p]
d1_010_0290,It must have been a terrible loss for her too.[l][p]
d1_010_0291,Yeah. I do feel a lil' bad for her when[r]I think about how sad she must be.[l][p]
d1_010_0292,And I...[r]I saw him at the gardens the night he died.[l][p]
d1_010_0293,Oh no...[l][p]
d1_010_0294,Whenever I would get worked up over something,[r]Yoshimi always took me straight to that park.[l][p]
d1_010_0295,Then he'd listen to whatever it was I was pissed[r]off about.[l][p]
d1_010_0296,That day, he called me over there like usual.[l][p]
d1_010_0297,But something seemed off about him.[r]Like he was worried about something?[l][p]
d1_010_0298,Worried about something?[l][p]
d1_010_0299,Yeah. He [c3]asked me for a favor[c0], too.[r]That was pretty unusual.[l][p]
d1_010_0300,A favor? What kind of favor?[l][p]
d1_010_0301,He handed me a weird [c3]talisman[c0] and asked me to hold[r]on to it for him.[l][p]
d1_010_0302,A talisman?[l][p]
d1_010_0303,Yeah, just a normal good luck charm.[r]I figured if that's it, then sure, I'll take it.[l][p]
d1_010_0304,I have it with me now.[l][p]
d1_010_0305,But that wasn't all.[l][p]
d1_010_0306,Then he told me that he wanted me to look for a[r][c3]talisman[c0] Michiyo Shiraishi had that looked[r]like this one.
d1_010_0307,Huh? Michiyo? What does she[r]have to do with this?[l][p]
d1_010_0308,Yoshimi had been meeting up and talking with her.[l][p]
d1_010_0309,While they were together, he noticed that[r]she had like a special talisman or something.[l][p]
d1_010_0310,But apparently Michiyo always avoided the subject.[l][p]
d1_010_0311,A talisman that Michiyo had...[l][p]
d1_010_0312,He knew that I knew her, so that's why he asked[r]me, he said.[l][p]
d1_010_0313,Could there have been something that Michiyo couldn't[r]tell even the police about...?[l][p]
d1_010_0314,I know things at home were a little...complicated.[l][p]
d1_010_0315,From what I heard, Michiyo was keeping her mouth[r]shut about what Jonouchi was doing to her.[l][p]
d1_010_0316,Hard to talk with the cops when someone's got dirt[r]on you.[l][p]
d1_010_0317,And I didn't squeal on anything[r]about Michiyo either.[l][p]
d1_010_0318,...[l][p]
d1_010_0319,Michiyo... What is it that had such[r]a strong grip on you?[l][p]
d1_010_0320,So basically...[l][p]
d1_010_0321,Yoshimi didn't just have his eye on Michiyo,[r]but her talisman too.[l][p]
d1_010_0322,But after she died, he didn't know where it[r]ended up.[l][p]
d1_010_0323,So since I knew her from school, he wanted me to[r]look into it for him.[l][p]
d1_010_0324,Is there something...special about the two[r]talismans? I wonder why he gave it to you.[l][p]
d1_010_0325,Hell if I know. When I looked inside it there's[r]just a weird, kinda grimy scrap of wood.[l][p]
d1_010_0326,So you've seen inside it.[l][p]
d1_010_0327,But from the way he was actin' it seemed[r]important to him somehow.[l][p]
d1_010_0328,But to be honest, what he was asking is such a[r]pain in the ass, I figured he had to be serious[r]about it.[l][p]
d1_010_0329,Oh... And since he died right after that...[l][p]
d1_010_0330,Yeah. He even said to me—[l][p]
d1_010_0331,"If anything happens to me,[r]take those two talismans."[l][p]
d1_010_0332,"Give them to a guy named [c3]Nakagoshi[c0] at the[r]police department."[l][p]
d1_010_0333,Knowing what I know now, he probably felt[r]that something was gonna happen to him.[l][p]
d1_010_0334,Hm? Nakagoshi...?[l][p]
d1_010_0335,Hm? Do you know him, Mio?[l][p]
d1_010_0336,No, I've just heard the name...[r]I think...[l][p]
d1_010_0337,So there really is a Nakagoshi.[r]That's a relief, at least.[l][p]
d1_010_0338,Anyway, it didn't feel right just ignoring a dead[r]guy's last request.[l][p]
d1_010_0339,Hitomi.[l][p]
d1_010_0340,Yeah?[l][p]
d1_010_0341,That talisman... Would you mind if I had a look at it?[l][p]
d1_010_0342,...[l][p]
d1_010_0343,Sorry, but I don't trust you all that much yet.[l][p]
d1_010_0344,It's important to me.[l][p]
d1_010_0345,Oh... Okay.[l][p]
d1_010_0346,So... Last night you were looking for[r]the talisman Michiyo had?[l][p]
d1_010_0347,Yeah.[l][p]
d1_010_0348,And I figured that piece of garbage teacher would[r]know the most about Michiyo.[l][p]
d1_010_0349,...[l][p]
d1_010_0350,I asked him yesterday afternoon if he knew[r]anything about her talisman.[l][p]
d1_010_0351,He gave me some cryptic response like[r]"I can't talk about it now.[r]Come to the school tonight."[l][p]
d1_010_0352,He even gave me the code to the lock[r]on the back entrance.[l][p]
d1_010_0353,He seemed pretty willing to give it out,[r]so I wouldn't be surprised if he's used it for[r]secret meetings before.[l][p]
d1_010_0354,Yuck... I can only imagine.[l][p]
d1_010_0355,We climbed over the front gate to get in...[l][p]
d1_010_0356,So yeah, we met up in the classroom in the[r]middle of the night.[l][p]
d1_010_0357,But nothing he said made any sense.[l][p]
d1_010_0358,Like that I was really Michiyo and stuff like[r]that.[l][p]
d1_010_0359,He went on and on about how it was my fault and[r]that if only I hadn't been around or something.[l][p]
d1_010_0360,He grabbed a hold of me, breathing heavily...[l][p]
d1_010_0361,Eep![l][p]
d1_010_0362,W-were you okay!?[l][p]
d1_010_0363,Yeah. That's right when you two showed up.[l][p]
d1_010_0364,I was able to get away while Jonouchi was[r]freakin' out.[l][p]
d1_010_0365,Oh my gosh![r]Good thing you got away![l][p]
d1_010_0366,So it's really all thanks to you two that I[r]got away.[l][p]
d1_010_0367,But I didn't get any info about the talisman,[r]so the whole thing was sort of a bust.[l][p]
d1_010_0368,Afterward, I was wonderin' what you two were[r]up to, so I hid nearby.[l][p]
d1_010_0369,Then I saw you and Old Man Ashimiya talkin',[r]and then Mio showed up.[l][p]
d1_010_0370,Oh, you did?[l][p]
d1_010_0371,That's also why I saw Jonouchi come back[r]outside and bite it.[l][p]
d1_010_0372,I see...[l][p]
d1_010_0373,So you were only here to look for Michiyo's[r]talisman.[l][p]
d1_010_0374,I was dumb to fall for that creep[r]Jonouchi's trap so easy.[l][p]
d1_010_0375,It coulda gone a lot worse, but I lucked out.[l][p]
d1_010_0376,What did you mean by Mr. Jonouchi "acting[r]like scum"? Was he doing something bad?[l][p]
d1_010_0377,...[l][p]
d1_010_0378,You know Michiyo Shiraishi, right?[r]The girl who killed herself.[l][p]
d1_010_0379,Huh? Michiyo...!?[l][p]
d1_010_0380,I dunno everything, but that creep of a teacher[r]had some dirt on her.[l][p]
d1_010_0381,And he was using it to blackmail her—call her up[r]after school and make her do whatever he wanted.
d1_010_0382,Wh-what!?[l][p]
d1_010_0383,What—What do you mean when you say...whatever[r]he wanted?[l][p]
d1_010_0384,I'll leave it to your imagination.[r]Nothin' that a couple model students[r]like you would ever get involved in.[l][p]
d1_010_0385,No, no way, that's...! How!?[r]What do you mean by dirt?[l][p]
d1_010_0386,I don't know anything about this![r]How could I not have known about this!?[l][p]
d1_010_0387,Yakko, I know how you feel, but try to calm down.[l][p]
d1_010_0388,You got guts acting like you were her friend.[l][p]
d1_010_0389,Jonouchi really did a number on both Michiyo's[r]body and soul.[l][p]
d1_010_0390,...[l][p]
d1_010_0391,She probably felt she couldn't tell anyone, like she[r]had to suffer alone.[l][p]
d1_010_0392,No... How terrible...![l][p]
d1_010_0393,Hitomi, how do you know about this?[l][p]
d1_010_0394,I just happened to walk in on it.[l][p]
d1_010_0395,I know the spots around school people go to[r]when they want to stay out of sight.[l][p]
d1_010_0396,He ran off in a panic when I yelled at him[r]asking what he was doing.[l][p]
d1_010_0397,Walked in on it...?[l][p]
d1_010_0398,I couldn't just leave her alone, lookin' like she was[r]about to cry, so I stuck around for a bit.[l][p]
d1_010_0399,She told me everything that happened in whispers.[l][p]
d1_010_0400,She probably figured I wasn't the type to[r]spread that stuff around.[l][p]
d1_010_0401,But she never asked for my help. She told me that[r]she was fine and to keep it a secret.[l][p]
d1_010_0402,Michiyo... Why...[l][p]
d1_010_0403,She probably thought she just had to[r]grit her teeth till it was through.[l][p]
d1_010_0404,She was naive. I tried to tell her that if you[r]give guys like that an inch, they'll take a mile.[l][p]
d1_010_0405,She kept saying about how it was her punishment.[r]She was soft.[l][p]
d1_010_0406,No...[l][p]
d1_010_0407,Course, Jonouchi didn't change. He kept on doing[r]what he was doing.[l][p]
d1_010_0408,I don't understand either of them.[r]But that's as much as I was involved.[l][p]
d1_010_0409,And then she killed herself.[r]Nothing I can do about it now.[l][p]
d1_010_0410,...[l][p]
d1_010_0411,Hitomi. If you knew about it,[r]then why didn't you—[l][p]
d1_010_0412,You tryin' to say it's my fault?[l][p]
d1_010_0413,She told me not to say anything.[r]She told me she was fine.[l][p]
d1_010_0414,So what the hell more responsibility do I have[r]other than what I already did?[l][p]
d1_010_0415,Yakko. There's no point blaming Hitomi.[l][p]
d1_010_0416,Michiyo... Why...?[l][p]
d1_010_0417,That creep of a teacher had some dirt on Michiyo[r]and was using it to get her to do whatever he[r]wanted.[l][p]
d1_010_0418,Did you hear what this dirt was?[l][p]
d1_010_0419,Nope. Never heard what it was.[l][p]
d1_010_0420,But from the sound of it, he'd been[r]blackmailing her since about a year ago.[l][p]
d1_010_0421,For that long...?[l][p]
d1_010_0422,The dick probably caught her doing something[r]she shouldn't have been.[l][p]
d1_010_0423,She looked well-behaved, but there's more[r]to a person than meets the eye, y'know.[l][p]
d1_010_0424,There must be some reason...[l][p]
d1_010_0425,Dunno. Got nothing to do with me.[l][p]
d1_010_0426,...And that's all I know.[r]Happy?[l][p]
d1_010_0427,I still gotta look for the talisman.[l][p]
d1_010_0428,Sure. Thank you, Hitomi.[l][p]
d1_010_0429,Oh, if you two find out anything[r]about Michiyo's talisman...[l][p]
d1_010_0430,We'll be sure to let you know.[l][p]
d1_010_0431,Thanks.[l][p]
d1_010_0432,Oh, can we get your contact info?[r]Where can we normally find you?[l][p]
d1_010_0433,Right... I'm not home most of the time.[r]Usually I'm at a friend's place.[l][p]
d1_010_0434,...Here's the phone number.[l][p]
d1_010_0435,Thanks. We'll call her if we need to talk[r]with you.[l][p]
d1_010_0436,And, um...[l][p]
d1_010_0437,What is it?[l][p]
d1_010_0438,You're easier to talk to than I imagined! I was[r]kinda scared at first, but not anymore![l][p]
d1_010_0439,Sh-shut up. You were the one avoiding me.[l][p]
d1_010_0440,Anyway, catch you later.[r]...And don't die out there, okay?[l][p]
d1_010_0441,Thanks. We'll be careful.[l][p]
d1_010_0442,All right then.[l][p]
d1_010_0443,We got a lot of new information.[l][p]
d1_010_0444,Sounds like Mr. Jonouchi was killed by a curse,[r]just as we thought.[l][p]
d1_010_0445,Which means there was a curse bearer[r]at the school. ...Multiple, in fact.[l][p]
d1_010_0446,Multiple!? You think so?[l][p]
d1_010_0447,Yes. The curse echo we experienced in the school[r]and the one that killed Mr. Jonouchi seem to be[r]different.[l][p]
d1_010_0448,The people in the school at the time other than[r]us were...[l][p]
d1_010_0449,Mr. Jonouchi, Hitomi...[r]And Old Man Ashimiya, who you ran into.[l][p]
d1_010_0450,I was thinking it would be among them, but...[l][p]
d1_010_0451,...But there was one more person. Hitomi saw[r]a girl in a school uniform with braids.[l][p]
d1_010_0452,From what Hitomi was saying, it doesn't seem[r]like she's one.[l][p]
d1_010_0453,Mr. Jonouchi is pretty suspicious though...[l][p]
d1_010_0454,If he were a curse bearer, it would certainly[r]explain why he was killed.[l][p]
d1_010_0455,Right. That's why I say there are multiple.[l][p]
d1_010_0456,Oh right. The person who killed Mr. Jonouchi[r]would have to be one too.[l][p]
d1_010_0457,Which means it must be either the mysterious[r]girl or Old Man Ashimiya?[l][p]
d1_010_0458,Yeah. We should certainly be careful of them.[r]That said...[l][p]
d1_010_0459,The mysterious girl and the fact that Mr. Jonouchi[r]thought it was Michiyo that was attacking him[r]has me wondering.[l][p]
d1_010_0460,Of course I doubt Michiyo herself was actually[r]there, but...[l][p]
d1_010_0461,Oh! I just remembered! I also saw Mr. Araishi[r]outside the main gate last night.[l][p]
d1_010_0462,You did?[l][p]
d1_010_0463,It's likely he's involved with the curses given[r]that he's the one doing research on the Rite of[r]Resurrection...[l][p]
d1_010_0464,So we'll have to be careful of Old Man Ashimiya[r]and Mr. Araishi...[l][p]
d1_010_0465,I want to believe that not all curse bearers[r]will be hostile, but...[l][p]
d1_010_0466,As for what to do now...[l][p]
d1_010_0467,I'd like to find who is responsible for the Feast[r]of Shadows that set this off and how they did it.[l][p]
d1_010_0468,I don't think we'll be able to end this without[r]stopping it at its source.[l][p]
d1_010_0469,Huh. That makes sense.[l][p]
d1_010_0470,In which case, next we should do...what exactly?[l][p]
d1_010_0471,We'll need to talk with Mr. Araishi.[r]He definitely knows something.[l][p]
d1_010_0472,It should be safer during the day, so I think[r]we should try to look for him.[l][p]
d1_010_0473,Got it. I'll help in any way I can.[l][p]
d1_010_0474,But the school is closed...[r]I wonder where he could be.[l][p]
d1_010_0475,Let's try heading some place someone may know[r]where he is.[l][p]
d1_010_0476,Hmm, where to go then...[l][p]

d1_020_0014,You know, normally you'd be breaking school rules[r]just by stepping foot in a cafe.[l][p]
d1_020_0015,I'll be in hot water if you lied about having[r]permission from the police, remember that.[l][p]
d1_020_0016,We know! It'll be okay.[l][p]
d1_020_0017,...[l][p]
d1_020_0018,...So? What did you want to ask me?[l][p]
d1_020_0019,!
d1_020_0020,Talk
d1_020_0021,Inside
d1_020_0022,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori08 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #8[c0] discovered!
d1_020_0023,A cafe... I've never been to one before...[r]How exciting![l][p]
d1_020_0024,It's pretty smelly inside because of the cigarette[r]smoke, but...[l][p]
d1_020_0025,About my curse stone
d1_020_0026,Yakko, if you would.[l][p]
d1_020_0027,Right.[r]We wanted to ask you about this...[l][p]
d1_020_0028,Oh my! A curse stone![l][p]
d1_020_0029,An okame mask, that must mean...[r]The Fool's Procession![l][p]
d1_020_0030,You two were at the school last night!?[r]Damn! There of all places![l][p]
d1_020_0031,...Yakko! You're one of them?[r]You're a curse bearer![l][p]
d1_020_0032,Um, uh... Please calm down, Mr. Araishi...[l][p]
d1_020_0033,Your reaction is too intense,[r]it's kind of scaring me.[l][p]
d1_020_0034,Ahem, sorry about that. I'm afraid I got ahead[r]of myself.[l][p]
d1_020_0035,What is it you wanted to know about your[r]curse stone?[l][p]
d1_020_0036,<i>Hm, what would be the best way to[r]approach this...
d1_020_0037,Flatter him
d1_020_0038,Intimidate him
d1_020_0039,You're going to tell us about this thing.[l][p]
d1_020_0040,Hmph. Is that any tone to take with a teacher?[l][p]
d1_020_0041,I could always tell people that you dragged us[r]into a cafe by force...[l][p]
d1_020_0042,Wh-what!? Are you threatening me!?[l][p]
d1_020_0043,...Damn it. Fine. Ask what you will.[l][p]
d1_020_0044,It's just, a brilliant teacher like you must[r]know an awful lot about these curse stones...[l][p]
d1_020_0045,Well... It's true that I'm likely the person[r]most well-versed in this matter.[l][p]
d1_020_0046,You're the only one we can count on,[r]Mr. Araishi. Won't you help us? Please?[l][p]
d1_020_0047,Oh, am I now? In that case, there's no harm[r]hearing what you have to ask.[l][p]
d1_020_0048,Thank you.[r]Let's see...[l][p]
d1_020_0049,Why is everything with the Rite of Resurrection[r]and Seven Mysteries curse stones happening now?[l][p]
d1_020_0050,Oho, taken an interest now that you've[r]received one of the curses, have you?[l][p]
d1_020_0051,You sound like a researcher, starting your[r]questioning with your subject's origins.[l][p]
d1_020_0052,Um, Mr. Araishi, you're not the one[r]who triggered the curse, are you?[l][p]
d1_020_0053,No, I'm afraid I had nothing to do with that.[l][p]
d1_020_0054,Rather, I wasn't even attempting to do so[r]in the first place.[l][p]
d1_020_0055,Completing the Rite itself has nothing to[r]do with my research.[l][p]
d1_020_0056,Then, do you know of the ancient onmyodo[r]ritual known as the Feast of Shadows?[l][p]
d1_020_0057,What is that? Something from the occult?[l][p]
d1_020_0058,Ms. Kurosuzu, you look like the type to be[r]interested in those things, but it's outside my[r]field of expertise.[l][p]
d1_020_0059,Um, in that case...[l][p]
d1_020_0060,Why do you think the Rite and curses have[r]appeared now?[l][p]
d1_020_0061,I believe this is the intentional work of someone.[l][p]
d1_020_0062,Hmm... It's certainly not something that would[r]happen by accident.[l][p]
d1_020_0063,Why is it you want to know?[l][p]
d1_020_0064,Well, uh...[l][p]
d1_020_0065,He may not tell us anything else if we say that[r]we're trying to stop the curse...[l][p]
d1_020_0066,We need to make something up...[l][p]
d1_020_0067,Right...[l][p]
d1_020_0068,Make something up
d1_020_0069,Well you see, we just have such intellectual[r]curiosity, and uh, think it could really help your[r]research.[l][p]
d1_020_0070,...I see.[r]Now that you mention it...[l][p]
d1_020_0071,...[l][p]
d1_020_0072,Seems like he's reluctant to answer.[l][p]
d1_020_0073,Hmm... Then how about...[l][p]
d1_020_0074,Ask about his research
d1_020_0075,Act disappointed
d1_020_0076,Um, then...[l][p]
d1_020_0077,What does that Record of Fates that you've been[r]researching say about the Rite of Resurrection?[l][p]
d1_020_0078,Oho, I see! That's what you want[r]to know.[l][p]
d1_020_0079,Oh, we figured you would know since you're so[r]smart... How disappointing...[l][p]
d1_020_0080,How dare you! You make it sounds like I'm[r]stupid![l][p]
d1_020_0081,You couldn't be more wrong! Do you realize[r]how devoted I am to this research?[l][p]
d1_020_0082,Allow me to first elucidate you regarding the[r]author of the Record of Fates.[l][p]
d1_020_0083,A special privilege, I might add, since[r]I have yet to publish this in a paper.[l][p]
d1_020_0084,Yeah... Okay.[l][p]
d1_020_0085,The Record of Fates was written two hundred years[r]ago in the latter half of the Edo period.[l][p]
d1_020_0086,It was written by a skilled, but little-known[r]onmyoji called [c4]Seiman Tsuchimikado[c0].[l][p]
d1_020_0087,This is important stuff.[r]If nothing else, remember this.[l][p]
d1_020_0088,Seiman Tsuchimikado? I've never heard of him...[l][p]
d1_020_0089,I'm sure you haven't.[l][p]
d1_020_0090,He was born into a famed onmyoji family, but split[r]away to practice forbidden arts in secret.[l][p]
d1_020_0091,He used whatever name was most convenient[r]for the situation, so his real name barely exists[r]in records.[l][p]
d1_020_0092,Or so it is written in the Record of Fates.[l][p]
d1_020_0093,Huh...[l][p]
d1_020_0094,As brilliant as Seiman was, he was also an eccentric.[l][p]
d1_020_0095,He delved into researching the Rite of[r]Resurrection, a legendary forbidden ritual that[r]had never been completed.[l][p]
d1_020_0096,However, by involving himself with this forbidden[r]ritual, he was expelled from his family,[r]and eventually found himself in Honjo in Edo.[l][p]
d1_020_0097,The Record of Fates are the writings Seiman[r]recorded on the road to Edo.[l][p]
d1_020_0098,I see...[l][p]
d1_020_0099,So he wrote how to perform the Rite itself?[l][p]
d1_020_0100,The Rite of Resurrection makes use of Abe no[r]Seimei's specialty, the Taizan Fukun Ritual, a[r]means of communicating with the afterlife.[l][p]
d1_020_0101,It uses soul dregs to replicate the soul of[r]a dead spirit that has been called.[l][p]
d1_020_0102,Oh, wow... I never knew something like that[r]existed.[l][p]
d1_020_0103,Thus, it is thought the only ones who can use it[r]are those with the ability to turn human souls[r]into soul dregs in the first place.[l][p]
d1_020_0104,So the Rite of Resurrection calls for that[r]ritual to be performed in advance.[l][p]
d1_020_0105,Then, when the soul dregs are gathered and[r]infused with the wish of whoever is performing the[r]ritual, it can be completed.[l][p]
d1_020_0106,The contents written in the Record of Fates...[r]end there.[l][p]
d1_020_0107,There's no more?[l][p]
d1_020_0108,What about the Seven Mysteries or the[r]curse stones?[l][p]
d1_020_0109,There's nothing written about them in the[r]Record of Fates. The curse stones are separate[r]from the Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
d1_020_0110,Their curse is one used to enable one who is[r]unable to perform such rituals to be able to use[r]the Rite.[l][p]
d1_020_0111,Huh... That's similar to what Mio said, actually.[l][p]
d1_020_0112,How are the Seven Mysteries related to the Rite?
d1_020_0113,Excuse me, Mr. Araishi?[l][p]
d1_020_0114,What is it, Ms. Kurosuzu?[l][p]
d1_020_0115,You published a theory before the[r]incident took place...[l][p]
d1_020_0116,It said that the Rite of Resurrection and origin[r]of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo are related somehow.[l][p]
d1_020_0117,What proof did you have of that?[l][p]
d1_020_0118,You really know your stuff.[r]But about that...[l][p]
d1_020_0119,That was a somewhat sensationalized piece[r]written for occult magazines.[l][p]
d1_020_0120,Oh... Really? It was just nonsense, then?[l][p]
d1_020_0121,Not exactly. Rather...[l][p]
d1_020_0122,It's not a complete fabrication.[r]There is a basis for it.[l][p]
d1_020_0123,And that is...?[l][p]
d1_020_0124,Well...[l][p]
d1_020_0125,I suppose there's no harm telling a couple[r]students so passionate about this topic.[l][p]
d1_020_0126,Thank you![l][p]
d1_020_0127,This is something I discovered from referencing[r]numerous texts unrelated to the Record of Fates.[l][p]
d1_020_0128,It was just after Seiman arrived in Honjo.[l][p]
d1_020_0129,There are records of a [c3]conflict over a ritual[r]used to resurrect the dead[c0] in Honjo.
d1_020_0130,A conflict over resurrecting the dead...?[l][p]
d1_020_0131,I don't know the details.[l][p]
d1_020_0132,"A man enticed the public with claims of a[r]spell that could resurrect the dead, causing a[r]conflict that ended tragically with nine dead."[l][p]
d1_020_0133,That is the only remaining reference.[l][p]
d1_020_0134,Nine people...fighting over a resurrection ritual...[l][p]
d1_020_0135,I call this tragedy the [c4]Honjo Incident[c0],[r]and it has long been a subject of my research.[l][p]
d1_020_0136,And I suspect that this Honjo Incident might be[r]the very [c3]origin of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo[c0].[l][p]
d1_020_0137,So what you're saying is...[l][p]
d1_020_0138,The resurrection ritual at the root of the[r]Honjo Incident is Seiman's Rite of Resurrection?[l][p]
d1_020_0139,Yes. That is how the Record of Fates ties[r]everything together.[l][p]
d1_020_0140,To put it in chronological order, first Seiman[r]brought the Rite of Resurrection to Edo.[l][p]
d1_020_0141,We can assume that by this point Seiman was[r]likely using a different name.[l][p]
d1_020_0142,Then, in Honjo, nine people fought to the death[r]over this Rite...the Honjo Incident.[l][p]
d1_020_0143,After that, the incident was covered up by an[r]interested party, preventing it from being[r]recorded in history fully.[l][p]
d1_020_0144,Eventually, it was passed down in incomplete[r]pieces, becoming known as the Seven Mysteries of[r]Honjo.[l][p]
d1_020_0145,That's more or less the course of events.[l][p]
d1_020_0146,So that's how they're connected...[l][p]
d1_020_0147,Then if I'm getting this right...[l][p]
d1_020_0148,The Seven Mysteries were basically required to[r]gather the soul dregs necessary for the Rite...[l][p]
d1_020_0149,Hehehe. And there's more.[l][p]
d1_020_0150,...?[l][p]
d1_020_0151,With this most recent occurrence of the curse...[l][p]
d1_020_0152,I've become even more confident in my theory.[l][p]
d1_020_0153,You are?[l][p]
d1_020_0154,Yes, the reason for it being...[l][p]
d1_020_0155,The [c4]resentful memories[c0] of the[r]Seven Mysteries etched into those who[r]received the curse stones.[l][p]
d1_020_0156,Resentful memories...[l][p]
d1_020_0157,Yakko. If you really are a curse bearer...[l][p]
d1_020_0158,Then when you obtained your curse stone,[r]you would have had a resentful memory[r]imprinted in your mind.[l][p]
d1_020_0159,Oh, I did![l][p]
d1_020_0160,Exactly. Those memories are what happened[r]in the [c3]final moments of the nine[c0] who died in the[r]Honjo Incident.[l][p]
d1_020_0161,Broadly speaking, they involve dying while[r]bearing some kind of deep resentment.[l][p]
d1_020_0162,The nine victims became the nine curse echoes,[r]which over time came to be spoken of[r]as the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
d1_020_0163,Thus, gathering the resentful memories[r]granted by the present curses and[r]connecting them together...[l][p]
d1_020_0164,It will reveal once and for all what happened[r]during the Honjo incident.[l][p]
d1_020_0165,Huh...[l][p]
d1_020_0166,That's why you must tell me about the resentful[r]memory of your Fool's Procession, Yakko.[l][p]
d1_020_0167,Urk...[l][p]
d1_020_0168,Mio... Should I...?[l][p]
d1_020_0169,Yeah. I think it's okay. We need all the[r]information we can get.[l][p]
d1_020_0170,Tell him about the resentful memory
d1_020_0171,Okay, Mr. Araishi. I'll tell you about the[r]memory of the Fool's Procession.[l][p]
d1_020_0172,Excellent.[l][p]
d1_020_0173,...so basically, it's about a woman who died[r]falling from a yagura tower at a festival.[l][p]
d1_020_0174,Hm, interesting.[l][p]
d1_020_0175,It's not that one then...[l][p]
d1_020_0176,Not that one? What do you mean?[l][p]
d1_020_0177,Among the nine victims at the Honjo Incident,[r]that is to say, the nine curse echoes...[l][p]
d1_020_0178,[c3]One of them is Seiman himself[c0].[r]Or so I suspect.
d1_020_0179,Huh...? Seiman was one of the victims[r]at the Honjo Incident, too?[l][p]
d1_020_0180,Meaning an onmyoji as powerful as him[r]also became a curse echo?[l][p]
d1_020_0181,Right. It would make sense that the curse stone[r]tied to a curse echo like that would be special.[l][p]
d1_020_0182,The power of a curse stone is different based on[r]the curse echo?[l][p]
d1_020_0183,Mio, Mio, Mio! Then maybe with Seiman's curse[r]echo we could...![l][p]
d1_020_0184,Yes... We may be able to settle this whole[r]situation.[l][p]
d1_020_0185,...?[r]Hey! What are you two whispering about?[l][p]
d1_020_0186,Oh, nothing! Sorry.[l][p]
d1_020_0187,About the resentful memories
d1_020_0188,Mr. Araishi, how many of the resentful memories[r]have you gathered so far?[l][p]
d1_020_0189,I have learned a number of them.[l][p]
d1_020_0190,The Evergreen Beech, the Foot-Washing Mansion,[r]the Everburning Lantern...and now the Fool's[r]Procession makes four.[l][p]
d1_020_0191,Of those, the most important are the[r]Foot-Washing Mansion and the Evergreen Beech.[l][p]
d1_020_0192,What are they about?[l][p]
d1_020_0193,First, the Foot-Washing Mansion.[l][p]
d1_020_0194,An onmyoji appears distinctly in this one.[l][p]
d1_020_0195,Really...?[l][p]
d1_020_0196,But not Seiman, I'm afraid.[l][p]
d1_020_0197,A female onmyoji who sought the Rite of[r]Resurrection due to her obsession with her[r]personal appearance.[l][p]
d1_020_0198,Her legs, which she had always taken pride in, were[r]stricken with corruption after she was defeated by[r]Seiman.[l][p]
d1_020_0199,Her curse echo is notable for being particularly[r]easy to fulfill the requirements necessary to use[r]the curse.[l][p]
d1_020_0200,That detective did well to escape this one.[l][p]
d1_020_0201,So a female onmyoji and rival of Seiman[r]was involved in the Honjo Incident...[l][p]
d1_020_0202,That certainly is interesting...[l][p]
d1_020_0203,Next, The Evergreen Beech.[l][p]
d1_020_0204,This curse echo is from a craftsman of[r]netsuke carvings named Jinkichi who was hanged[r]for spreading baseless rumors.[l][p]
d1_020_0205,He apparently spoke of something that granted[r][c3]the ability to bring back the dead[c0].[l][p]
d1_020_0206,The Rite of Resurrection![l][p]
d1_020_0207,Precisely. This man Jinkichi must have been[r]in contact with Seiman.[l][p]
d1_020_0208,If I could just collect all of the memories...[l][p]
d1_020_0209,Everything will be revealed, and the truth of the[r]Seven Mysteries will be mine.[l][p]
d1_020_0210,That is the knowledge I desire.[l][p]
d1_020_0211,Meaning you need to gather as much information[r]as you can from the curse bearers.[l][p]
d1_020_0212,Precisely.[l][p]
d1_020_0213,I have an agreement to exchange information with[r]those detectives.[l][p]
d1_020_0214,But they might not even find the other curse[r]bearers, so I must take measures of my own.[l][p]
d1_020_0215,What's the trigger for the curse to occur?
d1_020_0216,Another thing...[l][p]
d1_020_0217,Yes?[l][p]
d1_020_0218,You never really finished about what the trigger[r]for all of this was.[l][p]
d1_020_0219,Well, um... Ahem...[l][p]
d1_020_0220,I...don't know.[l][p]
d1_020_0221,...Really?[l][p]
d1_020_0222,You're not hiding something from us, are you?[l][p]
d1_020_0223,...[l][p]
d1_020_0224,It has something to do with how you obtained[r]the Record of Fates, right?[l][p]
d1_020_0225,...![l][p]
d1_020_0226,How did you really get a hold of[r]the Record of Fates?[l][p]
d1_020_0227,To tell you the truth, we're in a race against[r]time. It could be a disaster if we don't hurry.[l][p]
d1_020_0228,What are you talking about?[l][p]
d1_020_0229,Someone left a warning that at sundown today[r]they would use the curse to kill a lot of people.[l][p]
d1_020_0230,The one who left that message is the culprit[r]behind the Nejima Murders from twenty years ago.[l][p]
d1_020_0231,What...?[r]Something so terrible will happen...?[l][p]
d1_020_0232,I won't allow potentially hundreds of people[r]to become victims of a curse.[l][p]
d1_020_0233,I'll do anything in my power to stop it.[l][p]
d1_020_0234,...[l][p]
d1_020_0235,Mr. Araishi, please! Tell us everything you know![l][p]
d1_020_0236,I'm sorry, but I truly don't know anything.[l][p]
d1_020_0237,The truth is...[r]I was given the Record of Fates by a woman.[l][p]
d1_020_0238,A woman...?[l][p]
d1_020_0239,Well, her voice sounded like a woman's,[r]but I didn't actually see what she looked like.[l][p]
d1_020_0240,One month ago, while I was investigating[r]at night, I suddenly heard a formless voice.[l][p]
d1_020_0241,A woman's voice...?[l][p]
d1_020_0242,It said, "I entrust you with this ancient[r]manuscript, and the Rite of Resurrection held[r]within its pages..."[l][p]
d1_020_0243,"Spread rumors of this ritual as far and wide[r]as you can in the coming month."[l][p]
d1_020_0244,And before I knew it, an old document[r]had fallen down at my feet.[l][p]
d1_020_0245,One month... She specified the time period?[l][p]
d1_020_0246,I was told if I did that, I could study[r]the manuscript as much as I pleased.[l][p]
d1_020_0247,I wanted so badly to verify its authenticity,[r]I ended up accepting.[l][p]
d1_020_0248,I haven't heard anything from[r]the voice since then.[l][p]
d1_020_0249,It must have had you spread rumors in order[r]to strengthen the power of the curse...[l][p]
d1_020_0250,To tie together the curse and the desire[r]to seek out the Rite.[l][p]
d1_020_0251,This makes it likely that the owner of the voice[r]is the mastermind behind all of this...[l][p]
d1_020_0252,Hence I went public with the Record of Fates.[l][p]
d1_020_0253,Hihaku and occult magazines immediately jumping[r]at the news was a financial boon for me.[l][p]
d1_020_0254,Huh, Hihaku?[r]As in Hihaku Soaps?[l][p]
d1_020_0255,Right—I mean, no! That's not important![r]Just some personal business.[l][p]
d1_020_0256,...[l][p]
d1_020_0257,After that, I waited, trying to predict what[r]would occur in a month's time.[l][p]
d1_020_0258,That's when the curse began.[l][p]
d1_020_0259,Those are all the details I have.[l][p]
d1_020_0260,Is there anything else you know?
d1_020_0261,...[l][p]
d1_020_0262,Very well. I've told you this much, I may as well[r]give you one more thing.[l][p]
d1_020_0263,Thank you. What might that be?[l][p]
d1_020_0264,About Seiman's Record of Fates...[l][p]
d1_020_0265,There is a sort of continuation to it, another[r]document called the [c4]Record of Fates Yin Scroll[c0].
d1_020_0266,A continuation?[l][p]
d1_020_0267,Actually, a section written in Seiman's own[r]hand was appended to the manuscript.[l][p]
d1_020_0268,According to which, after the Honjo Incident,[r]Seiman lamented such a calamity taking place.[l][p]
d1_020_0269,He apparently wrote the [c3]addendum[c0] for the event[r]that the tragedy became its own curse.[l][p]
d1_020_0270,It seems he had an idea that the victims of the[r]Honjo Incident would turn into curse echoes and[r]be used to gather soul dregs.[l][p]
d1_020_0271,It supposedly details how to handle any trouble[r]that occurs as a result of the Rite of[r]Resurrection.[l][p]
d1_020_0272,Really...?[l][p]
d1_020_0273,Hold on a second.[l][p]
d1_020_0274,Don't you find that strange?[l][p]
d1_020_0275,What's the matter, Ms. Sakazaki? You think[r]my information inaccurate?[l][p]
d1_020_0276,If Seiman died in the Honjo Incident then[r]he couldn't have written an addendum.[l][p]
d1_020_0277,You really don't get it, do you?[l][p]
d1_020_0278,Huh...? Am I wrong?[l][p]
d1_020_0279,Have you forgotten the ability Seiman possessed?[l][p]
d1_020_0280,Of course not, he could use the Rite of Resur—[l][p]
d1_020_0281,Oh![l][p]
d1_020_0282,You're telling me Seiman used it on himself...?[l][p]
d1_020_0283,The Rite of Resurrection can be carried out[r]in advance so that it activates when the soul dregs[r]are gathered together.[l][p]
d1_020_0284,Then is it not possible that Seiman himself was[r]resurrected by the Rite after it all took place?[l][p]
d1_020_0285,But he'd still have to collect the soul dregs[r]needed to use the Rite...[l][p]
d1_020_0286,Yes, and that's why they died—the eight others[r]besides Seiman.[l][p]
d1_020_0287,What...?[l][p]
d1_020_0288,They died in the Honjo Incident for their soul[r]dregs...?[l][p]
d1_020_0289,That sounds like it's the same as what's[r]happening now...[l][p]
d1_020_0290,That's why I need the resentful memories—[r]to learn the truth.[l][p]
d1_020_0291,I get it now...[l][p]
d1_020_0292,The issue at hand is that the Yin Scroll[r]and the Record of Fates were supposed to have[r]been passed down as a set...[l][p]
d1_020_0293,When I received the Record of Fates, the Yin[r]Scroll was gone. Only this information was left.[l][p]
d1_020_0294,Supposedly [c3]Seiman's blood descendants[c0] guarded[r]it as they passed it down across generations.[l][p]
d1_020_0295,It seems that over their long history, the two[r]documents became separated and the scroll's[r]location lost as the family line branched.[l][p]
d1_020_0296,Seiman had descendants? So there's someone out[r]there related to him by blood even now?[l][p]
d1_020_0297,Yes. In fact, I've tried to trace the line as far[r]as I could.[l][p]
d1_020_0298,He wasn't a well-known onmyoji to begin with,[r]so a detailed family tree does not exist.[l][p]
d1_020_0299,It seems likely that the use of the manuscript has[r]been long forgotten, only being passed down[r]out of tradition.[l][p]
d1_020_0300,And since they aren't even aware of what they[r]have, tracking it down is quite tricky indeed.[l][p]
d1_020_0301,I wish I could ask whoever that voice belonged[r]to about the Yin Scroll...[l][p]
d1_020_0302,I'm sure you do...[l][p]
d1_020_0303,So basically...[l][p]
d1_020_0304,In the Record of Fates Yin Scroll, Seiman himself[r]wrote about ways to handle the curse and the[r]Rite, yes?[l][p]
d1_020_0305,Yes, that's right. I've been searching for it[r]all this time, but haven't found a single lead.[l][p]
d1_020_0306,So if you two find out anything about other[r]resentful memories or Yin Scroll...[l][p]
d1_020_0307,Tell me immediately... You owe me that much for[r]telling you all this, do you not?[l][p]
d1_020_0308,That's the real extent of everything I know.[l][p]
d1_020_0309,Yes, I understand.[l][p]
d1_020_0310,Thank you for your help![l][p]
d1_020_0311,If you bring me some useful information...[r]I'll take it into consideration for your[r]school grades as well. Hahaha![l][p]
d1_020_0312,<color=#ddd><font="TELOP"><cspace=-4px><voffset=-0.5em>1 p.m.
d1_020_0313,<align="center"><color=#ddd><cspace=0px><font="TELOP">路上[x0.3][r]<cspace=0px><font="MAIN">Street
d1_020_0314,We've learned a lot.[l][p]
d1_020_0315,So, to sum it up...[l][p]
d1_020_0316,There was a tragic incident with people[r]cursing each other for the Rite of Resurrection[r]in the Edo period as well.[l][p]
d1_020_0317,And the Record of Fates Yin Scroll may have info[r]we want, since it details how to stop the Rite.[l][p]
d1_020_0318,I think that's about it.[l][p]
d1_020_0319,Right.[l][p]
d1_020_0320,If we could just find the Yin Scroll, we might[r]be able to learn how to settle this situation.[l][p]
d1_020_0321,But even Mr. Araishi didn't have any leads on[r]where it is...[l][p]
d1_020_0322,How do we start looking for it?[l][p]
d1_020_0323,Someone involved in this now must have[r]some connection to it, I think.[l][p]
d1_020_0324,I have a feeling the mastermind who awakened[r]the curses is involved, too.[l][p]
d1_020_0325,Right...[l][p]
d1_020_0326,About what to do next
d1_020_0327,About the mastermind
d1_020_0328,About the nearby area
d1_020_0329,Oh, that reminds me, Mio.[l][p]
d1_020_0330,You know what's nearby here, don't you?[l][p]
d1_020_0331,Hm...?[l][p]
d1_020_0332,Oh... You mean where Michiyo...?[l][p]
d1_020_0333,Yeah. Where it happened.[l][p]
d1_020_0334,I was going there every day to leave flowers.[l][p]
d1_020_0335,Even though they always get cleared away anyways.[l][p]
d1_020_0336,I'm sure it must be hard to have to be[r]reminded of Michiyo's death all the time.[l][p]
d1_020_0337,Oh, that reminds me. Yakko?[l][p]
d1_020_0338,Yeah?[l][p]
d1_020_0339,When you asked me to do the spirit board two days[r]ago, did you come here that day too?[l][p]
d1_020_0340,Yeah. I left some flowers before going to school.[l][p]
d1_020_0341,Why?[l][p]
d1_020_0342,Did anything seem different that day?[l][p]
d1_020_0343,What's this all of a sudden?[l][p]
d1_020_0344,Though...now that you mention it...[l][p]
d1_020_0345,That day... I suddenly felt lightheaded and ended[r]up passing out for a little bit.[l][p]
d1_020_0346,But I came to right away and felt fine,[r]so I didn't think anything of it.[l][p]
d1_020_0347,I see...[l][p]
d1_020_0348,That's all I was wondering about, thanks.[l][p]
d1_020_0349,Hm...?[l][p]
d1_020_0350,Then...the place her body was discovered[r]is already back to normal.[l][p]
d1_020_0351,So... Mio.[r]What are we going to do next?[l][p]
d1_020_0352,Good question.[l][p]
d1_020_0353,It may be best to give the information we[r]just learned to Inspector Tsutsumi.[l][p]
d1_020_0354,We got a pretty big clue from hearing about the[r]Record of Fates Yin Scroll.[l][p]
d1_020_0355,Mr. Tsutsumi might know more about it.[l][p]
d1_020_0356,Should we go back to school then?[l][p]
d1_020_0357,Yeah. That's our point of contact, after all.[l][p]
d1_020_0358,Let's head to the school if there's nowhere[r]else we need to go.[l][p]
d1_020_0359,Whoever's behind that voice that gave[r]Mr. Araishi the Record of Fates...[l][p]
d1_020_0360,That must be the mastermind, don't you think?[l][p]
d1_020_0361,Yeah. And he said it sounded like it belonged[r]to a woman.[l][p]
d1_020_0362,Whoever it is, I bet they're scary...[l][p]
d1_020_0363,Huh? You don't sound like[r]the Yakko I know...[l][p]
d1_020_0364,"Then let's catch 'em and make 'em spill[r]the beans!"[l][p]
d1_020_0365,I thought you'd say something like that.[l][p]
d1_020_0366,R-really?[l][p]
d1_020_0367,I guess I'm just not really feeling that confident[r]right now...[l][p]
d1_020_0368,I understand.[l][p]
d1_020_0369,I don't know if it's related to that woman[r]behind the voice...[l][p]
d1_020_0370,But I'm also interested in the female onmyoji[r]who was a rival of Seiman.[l][p]
d1_020_0371,Excuse me! You girls over there![l][p]
d1_020_0372,Whoa![l][p]
d1_020_0373,Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but something[r]you said caught my attention.[l][p]
d1_020_0374,Um... And who might you be?[l][p]
d1_020_0375,I'm Yutaro Namigaki.[l][p]
d1_020_0376,Er, I should probably tell you...[l][p]
d1_020_0377,Until yesterday, I was a curse bearer.[r]That should clear things up.
d1_020_0378,A curse bearer!?[l][p]
d1_020_0379,Oh, you don't need to be scared.[r]I've already given up the curse stone[r]of the Foot-Washing Mansion.[l][p]
d1_020_0380,The Foot-Washing Mansion? So you're the one[r]Inspector Tsutsumi was talking about?[l][p]
d1_020_0381,Ah, you already know Inspector Tsutsumi? That[r]makes this simple. There's nothing to worry about.[l][p]
d1_020_0382,Oh...! Hey![l][p]
d1_020_0383,You're—[l][p]
d1_020_0384,In the driver's seat...![l][p]
d1_020_0385,Yakko?[l][p]
d1_020_0386,Y-yes! ...Wait, what?[l][p]
d1_020_0387,Just now... I... Was I doing something?[l][p]
d1_020_0388,Uh... Sorry. Mr. Namigaki, what might be[r]the matter?[l][p]
d1_020_0389,Right. I actually wanted to discuss something[r]with you two. Would you come with me[r]if you have a little time?[l][p]
d1_020_0390,Discuss something? With us?[l][p]
d1_020_0391,You were talking about Michiyo Shiraishi, right?[r]It's related to that.[l][p]
d1_020_0392,Huh...!?[l][p]
d1_020_0393,I'm sure you would learn a few things yourselves.[l][p]
d1_020_0394,If not now, later is fine. I'll be waiting[r]around Ryogoku Bridge.[l][p]
d1_020_0395,Something rubs me the wrong way about this, but[r]he mentioned Michiyo... What do we do?[l][p]
d1_020_0396,Talk to Yutaro
d1_020_0397,Go to the school first
d1_020_0398,Well, I suppose we may as well hear[r]what it is you have to say.[l][p]
d1_020_0399,Glad to hear it.[r]Then shall we relocate elsewhere?[l][p]
d1_020_0400,Sorry, but there's something we've got to take[r]care of. We'll have to pass.[l][p]
d1_020_0401,Is that so...[l][p]
d1_020_0402,Well, that's too bad.[l][p]
d1_020_0403,I'm in no rush, so I'll be waiting at[r]Ryogoku Bridge if you change your minds.[l][p]

d1_030_0003,Start from Classroom
d1_030_0004,Start from saying goodbye

d1_030_0018,Ain't that interesting.[r]The Record of Fates Yin Scroll, huh?[l][p]
d1_030_0019,...Well done, you two! That's some good info you[r]got from that teacher![l][p]
d1_030_0020,Thank you![l][p]
d1_030_0021,Good job, Boss.[r]Operation Schoolgirl was a success![l][p]
d1_030_0022,Erio. Stop making things sound weird.[l][p]
d1_030_0023,...Anyways, let's share what we found at[r]Michiyo Shiraishi's house.[l][p]
d1_030_0024,Yes, please![l][p]
d1_030_0025,Yes![l][p]
d1_030_0026,A man named Iwai...kidnapped sacrifices for[r]black magic...!?[l][p]
d1_030_0027,And Michiyo helped with the kidnapping?[l][p]
d1_030_0028,And Mr. Jonouchi used that to blackmail her?[l][p]
d1_030_0029,...![l][p]
d1_030_0030,About Michiyo Shiraishi
d1_030_0031,About the Record of Fates Yin Scroll
d1_030_0032,About Western Black Magic
d1_030_0033,About the mastermind
d1_030_0034,Based on the report and looking at the[r]circumstances surrounding the deaths of Jonouchi[r]and Iwai...[l][p]
d1_030_0035,If Michiyo Shiraishi did it...[r]It would make sense.[l][p]
d1_030_0036,Furthermore... There are signs that Michiyo[r]Shiraishi wanted someone to notice.[l][p]
d1_030_0037,Huh? Really!?[l][p]
d1_030_0038,The ribbon that was left at the scene of[r]Kohei's death is proof of that.[l][p]
d1_030_0039,Mio, I'm guessing you knew that already?[l][p]
d1_030_0040,Ah... Yes.[r]Ever since this morning.[l][p]
d1_030_0041,But there's one piece of information I[r]need.[l][p]
d1_030_0042,But... I think we're near her limit.[l][p]
d1_030_0043,...?[l][p]
d1_030_0044,So if we get this Record of Fates Yin Scroll, we'll[r]be able to dispel the curse?[l][p]
d1_030_0045,Yes. The source of this curse is a tragic event[r]called the Honjo Incident that dates back to the[r]Edo period...[l][p]
d1_030_0046,An onmyoji named Seiman Tsuchimikado is said to[r]have recorded a way to deal with the curse.[l][p]
d1_030_0047,So I think there may be a way to dispel the curse.[l][p]
d1_030_0048,Right.[r]I'll leave how to approach this to you, Mio.[l][p]
d1_030_0049,I'll check with the Paranormal Affairs Bureau as[r]well, but please make finding the Record of[r]Fates Yin Scroll your top priority.[l][p]
d1_030_0050,Understood.[l][p]
d1_030_0051,But how do we go about looking for it...?[l][p]
d1_030_0052,It's possible the descendants of Seiman have[r]inherited it, but I don't think they're aware[r]of its existence...[l][p]
d1_030_0053,It'd be nice if we had a clan crest or something[r]to go off of... Maybe we'll have to ask Paranormal[r]Affairs.[l][p]
d1_030_0054,Oh, right. About the mastermind, I had an idea.[l][p]
d1_030_0055,Huh...? What is it?[l][p]
d1_030_0056,This is about the [c3]chairwoman of Hihaku Soaps[c0],[r]isn't it...? You mentioned her when you were[r]telling us about that Iwai person.[l][p]
d1_030_0057,Yep. Whether the goal is to restore youth[r]or to resurrect someone, she's got her hands[r]all over this.[l][p]
d1_030_0058,She has money too. It would also match Hideki[r]Araishi's account of a woman's voice...[l][p]
d1_030_0059,An evil business lady with supernatural powers...[r]A classic setting![l][p]
d1_030_0060,If only we could confirm those powers of hers[r]were actually real...[l][p]
d1_030_0061,We'll need to keep an eye on her.[r]I'll tell HQ to look into her...[l][p]
d1_030_0062,That reminds me... Mio, was the Western[r]black magic used by Iwai and Nejima really[r]just an imitation?[l][p]
d1_030_0063,Huh? Why are you asking me?[l][p]
d1_030_0064,Oh, uh... Boss said that you knew about this[r]sort of thing...[l][p]
d1_030_0065,Do... Do you not?[l][p]
d1_030_0066,Um...well...[r]I mean, I have some knowledge, but...[l][p]
d1_030_0067,How strange...[r]I don't think I've ever told anyone that.[l][p]
d1_030_0068,It's okay, Mio![r]No one's judging you![l][p]
d1_030_0069,R-right...[r]But it still feels a little weird...[l][p]
d1_030_0070,So... What's your opinion on it as someone[r]familiar with Western black magic?[l][p]
d1_030_0071,Hm... If I could have a look at their grimoire[r]I could be sure, but...[l][p]
d1_030_0072,Based on their methods...I'd say they imitated[r]black magic popular around 300 years ago.[l][p]
d1_030_0073,It was advertised as magic anyone could use and[r]was employed as camouflage to evade witch hunters.[l][p]
d1_030_0074,It's notable because they purposefully required[r]living sacrifices to make it difficult to disprove[r]its authenticity.[l][p]
d1_030_0075,Wow, you know so much! I'm impressed![r]It totally matches with the vibe you've got going[r]on![l][p]
d1_030_0076,Wh-what do you mean by that...?[l][p]
d1_030_0077,Don't worry! Have some confidence![l][p]
d1_030_0078,Um... R-right.[r]Thanks? I guess?[l][p]
d1_030_0079,If that black magic is just an imitation then[r]we probably don't have to worry about it.[l][p]
d1_030_0080,I'm just glad things aren't getting even more[r]confusing then they already are![l][p]
d1_030_0081,Now then... If we're nearing the limit...[l][p]
d1_030_0082,I'll stop beating around the bush.[r]Time to tell it to you straight.[l][p]
d1_030_0083,Yakko Sakazaki.[l][p]
d1_030_0084,What, me?[r]Y-yes?[l][p]
d1_030_0085,Take out your curse stone and give it to Mio.[l][p]
d1_030_0086,My curse stone...?[l][p]
d1_030_0087,It's just been in my pocket all this time...[l][p]
d1_030_0088,Thanks. I'm just going to borrow it for a second.[l][p]
d1_030_0089,Well...?[l][p]
d1_030_0090,Yes...[l][p]
d1_030_0091,There are soul dregs inside, after all...
d1_030_0092,What!?[l][p]
d1_030_0093,How did this happen?[l][p]
d1_030_0094,I didn't do anything...![r]I swear! You have to believe me![l][p]
d1_030_0095,It's okay. We know.[l][p]
d1_030_0096,Yakko. Calm down and listen to what I'm about to[r]tell you.[l][p]
d1_030_0097,B-but...![l][p]
d1_030_0098,There's no mistake that Jonouchi and Iwai were[r]killed by that curse stone.[l][p]
d1_030_0099,But the one who committed the act is...[l][p]
d1_030_0100,...the ghost of Michiyo Shiraishi that is[r]inside you, Yakko Sakazaki...
d1_030_0101,What!?[l][p]
d1_030_0102,Wha—[r]Inside me...? What!?[l][p]
d1_030_0103,What do you mean...!?
d1_030_0104,What do you mean...!?[l][p]
d1_030_0105,It's okay, Yakko.[r]Please calm down and listen.[l][p]
d1_030_0106,You've been possessed, Yakko.[l][p]
d1_030_0107,By Michiyo's ghost.[l][p]
d1_030_0108,Wh-what...?[l][p]
d1_030_0109,It probably happened when you were offering[r]flowers at the site of the accident...[l][p]
d1_030_0110,Filled with regret, her lingering ghost reacted[r]to the presence of her old friend, and entered[r]you, Yakko...[l][p]
d1_030_0111,No way...!?[r]You mean Michiyo's ghost is inside me!?[l][p]
d1_030_0112,I've explained this once before, but just[r]because you've been possessed doesn't mean that[r]you lose control of yourself.[l][p]
d1_030_0113,Normally, the mind will reject such attempts[r]and it'd do nothing more than affect one's[r]mood or energy levels...[l][p]
d1_030_0114,But Michiyo had powerful spirit sense to begin[r]with.[l][p]
d1_030_0115,And because she was your friend, your mind[r]was...open to accepting Michiyo's spirit.[l][p]
d1_030_0116,So, for those reasons, your minds [c3]merged[c0][r]without any issue.[l][p]
d1_030_0117,It's going to be...difficult to separate her from[r]you at this point.[l][p]
d1_030_0118,Which also means it will be difficult to guide her[r]spirit to the afterlife.[l][p]
d1_030_0119,No way...[r]We've merged...?[l][p]
d1_030_0120,Me and Michiyo's minds are...?[l][p]
d1_030_0121,But... I don't feel different at all![l][p]
d1_030_0122,I mean, I'm...me![r]...I think?[l][p]
d1_030_0123,That's because after she merged with you, Michiyo[r]started to believe she was you as well.[l][p]
d1_030_0124,As a ghost possessing you, she's not fully[r]conscious, only really a jumble of vague memories.[l][p]
d1_030_0125,Still, there are traces of her consciousness and[r]memories as Michiyo Shiraishi.[l][p]
d1_030_0126,You have been acting a little different from usual...[l][p]
d1_030_0127,You would also sometimes react when coming into[r]contact with things with a powerful influence.[l][p]
d1_030_0128,R-really...?[l][p]
d1_030_0129,That having been said...[l][p]
d1_030_0130,If we don't have a proper understanding of the[r]regrets Michiyo Shiraishi had when she died[r]and why...[l][p]
d1_030_0131,It would be difficult to separate her from you.[r]That's why I didn't say anything. I'm sorry.[l][p]
d1_030_0132,If I carelessly provoked her ghost, it could[r]have risked causing her to dig even deeper into[r]your mind.[l][p]
d1_030_0133,Oh no...[l][p]
d1_030_0134,When we mentioned limits earlier, we mean that[r]by letting things proceed like this...[l][p]
d1_030_0135,There's a possibility that you will join[r]completely, making it impossible to separate her[r]ghost from you.[l][p]
d1_030_0136,If that happens, you'll never be able to tell which[r]of your thoughts belong to her and which belong[r]to you.[l][p]
d1_030_0137,What...? That's so scary![r]You mean I won't be myself anymore?[l][p]
d1_030_0138,Aww... But if it's Michiyo, then maybe it wouldn't[r]be so bad?[l][p]
d1_030_0139,Oh, I don't know![r]What should I do!?[l][p]
d1_030_0140,But...
d1_030_0141,Ah... But...[l][p]
d1_030_0142,It was actually Michiyo who used the curse[r]stone while I was unaware, wasn't it?[l][p]
d1_030_0143,Doesn't that mean her ghost has already taken[r]over my body...?[l][p]
d1_030_0144,W-well, about that...[l][p]
d1_030_0145,I think that's probably the effect of the curse[r]amplifying murderous impulses and the influence[r]of the Feast of Shadows...[l][p]
d1_030_0146,While you were sleeping, the ghost's powers[r]were boosted...[l][p]
d1_030_0147,And, strengthened by the Feast, Michiyo's[r]consciousness surfaced and took control of[r]your body.[l][p]
d1_030_0148,That's...!
d1_030_0149,Then...that means...
d1_030_0150,I was the one who killed them![l][p]
d1_030_0151,I cursed them both...![l][p]
d1_030_0152,Aaah...![l][p]
d1_030_0153,Yakko, no! You were being controlled![l][p]
d1_030_0154,Right, Inspector?[l][p]
d1_030_0155,...Yeah. That's right.[l][p]
d1_030_0156,It's likely she'd be recognized as not being[r]responsible for the crime due to the possession.[l][p]
d1_030_0157,It's not something you can control.[r]No need to worry about that.[l][p]
d1_030_0158,No! You're wrong![l][p]
d1_030_0159,I wanted to kill them too![l][p]
d1_030_0160,Those feelings must have come out![r]It's not only Michiyo's fault![l][p]
d1_030_0161,I mean, when I learned that Michiyo didn't[r]commit suicide...[l][p]
d1_030_0162,I wished that all the cruel adults around me[r]would just die![l][p]
d1_030_0163,I had the curse stone with me, and I wanted to[r]get revenge for Michiyo if the chance came...[r]That's how I felt![l][p]
d1_030_0164,Yakko![l][p]
d1_030_0165,Because... Because...![l][p]
d1_030_0166,Michiyo wasn't able to escape her terrible[r]situation![l][p]
d1_030_0167,It was so hard, it wouldn't be unusual for someone[r]to take their own life![l][p]
d1_030_0168,And I... I had this curse stone...[l][p]
d1_030_0169,I made Michiyo get revenge all by herself![l][p]
d1_030_0170,Michiyo tried so hard to keep on living in[r]silence! And I treated those feelings like they[r]were worthless![l][p]
d1_030_0171,I should have done it myself right away![l][p]
d1_030_0172,Aaah...![l][p]
d1_030_0173,I'm sorry![r]I'm so sorry, Michiyo![l][p]
d1_030_0174,Aaaaaah...! Aaaaaahhh...!!![l][p]
d1_030_0175,That's why...[l][p]
d1_030_0176,I killed them![l][p]
d1_030_0177,Yakko![l][p]
d1_030_0178,There you are.[l][p]
d1_030_0179,Oh, hi, Michiyo![l][p]
d1_030_0180,What is up with you! You've had me worried sick[r]since you haven't been coming to school lately![l][p]
d1_030_0181,It feels like it's been forever![r]I'm glad you seem to be doing good![l][p]
d1_030_0182,Yeah... Sorry.[r]And I'm sorry I didn't tell you why.[l][p]
d1_030_0183,I've always regretted it...[l][p]
d1_030_0184,Aw come on, you're acting like we aren't buds![l][p]
d1_030_0185,You tell me if anyone is making you sad and I'll[r]take care of them![l][p]
d1_030_0186,Haha... Thanks, Yakko.[l][p]
d1_030_0187,Actually... I'm here because there's something I[r]wanted to tell you.[l][p]
d1_030_0188,Really? What's the matter?[r]You can tell me anything![l][p]
d1_030_0189,Well... The truth is...[l][p]
d1_030_0190,I did something unforgivable to an innocent man...[l][p]
d1_030_0191,Saying that I was forced to and didn't have a[r]choice doesn't undo it...[l][p]
d1_030_0192,I'm sorry...[r]I feel so guilty...[l][p]
d1_030_0193,What...?[l][p]
d1_030_0194,I've done so much I can't take back.[r]All because I was weak.[l][p]
d1_030_0195,There's no escaping the hell that I've created[r]for myself.[l][p]
d1_030_0196,I couldn't handle it anymore. I started thinking[r]about killing him and dying myself.[l][p]
d1_030_0197,Neither of us deserve to live in this world...[l][p]
d1_030_0198,Wh-what...?[l][p]
d1_030_0199,But...something went wrong.[r]And that's why I died with regrets.[l][p]
d1_030_0200,But thanks to you, I finished what I wanted to do.[l][p]
d1_030_0201,Thank you...[r]And I'm sorry for dragging you into this.[l][p]
d1_030_0202,What...?[r]Wait! You don't need to apologize![l][p]
d1_030_0203,It's only now that I realize...[l][p]
d1_030_0204,And I know how selfish it is...[l][p]
d1_030_0205,But I hope you remember the time we spent together[r]as friends.[l][p]
d1_030_0206,And how we were able to be together at the end.[l][p]
d1_030_0207,Please... Don't forget me...[l][p]
d1_030_0208,Huh...?[r]No, Michiyo, wait![l][p]
d1_030_0209,Hm...?[l][p]
d1_030_0210,Huh...?[l][p]
d1_030_0211,You're awake?[r]Do you feel okay?[l][p]
d1_030_0212,I'm sorry I had to spring that all on you, Yakko.[l][p]
d1_030_0213,What...?[l][p]
d1_030_0214,Is this... Are we in the classroom?[l][p]
d1_030_0215,Huh...?[r]Was I...dreaming?[l][p]
d1_030_0216,I'm sorry to rush this along while you're still[r]gathering your feelings, but...[l][p]
d1_030_0217,We need to hear what Michiyo Shiraishi has to say.[r]Now.[l][p]
d1_030_0218,Right...[l][p]
d1_030_0219,And so, after considering what to do...[l][p]
d1_030_0220,It is true that Michiyo's consciousness has[r]mixed with yours.[l][p]
d1_030_0221,But if I summoned her ghost, we may be able[r]to establish some communication.[l][p]
d1_030_0222,Oh... I understand.[l][p]
d1_030_0223,So you thought to use the spirit board again?[l][p]
d1_030_0224,Yep.[r]I have a hunch.[l][p]
d1_030_0225,I think the spirit we called last time may have[r]actually been Michiyo herself.[l][p]
d1_030_0226,Really? You think?[l][p]
d1_030_0227,And that her spirit has been close to you ever[r]since then.[l][p]
d1_030_0228,Then, let's do it![r]I think we should! And I want to hear from her![l][p]
d1_030_0229,Very well. I have no idea if this will[r]work during daytime, but let's give it a try.[l][p]
d1_030_0230,Are you ready?[l][p]
d1_030_0231,I'm ready.
d1_030_0232,Hold on a minute.
d1_030_0233,Yeah. I'm ready.[l][p]
d1_030_0234,Sorry... I need a little time.[l][p]
d1_030_0235,No, it's okay.[r]Let me know when you're ready.[l][p]
d1_030_0236,...[l][p]
d1_030_0237,Thanks... I'm ready.[l][p]
d1_030_0238,Okay, here we go.[l][p]
d1_030_0239,Do you remember how to do it?[r]Place your finger on the 10-yen coin.
d1_030_0240,Right. Like this![l][p]
d1_030_0241,Good. Now do as I do.[l][p]
d1_030_0242,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. Please visit us.[l][p]
d1_030_0243,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board. Please visit us.[l][p]
d1_030_0244,"Please tell us if you are there."[l][p]
d1_030_0245,It's here...[l][p]
d1_030_0246,Now... Is it the spirit of Michiyo?[l][p]
d1_030_0247,Yakko, would you ask the spirit?[l][p]
d1_030_0248,All right.[l][p]
d1_030_0249,Are you Michiyo Shiraishi?
d1_030_0250,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board, are you[r]the spirit of Michiyo Shiraishi?[l][p]
d1_030_0251,Ah! It said yes![l][p]
d1_030_0252,Don't be so sure...[r]Some spirits like to play tricks.[l][p]
d1_030_0253,Can you try asking it a question only Michiyo[r]would know the answer to?[l][p]
d1_030_0254,A question only Michiyo would know the answer[r]to...[l][p]
d1_030_0255,Let's see... Then...[l][p]
d1_030_0256,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d1_030_0257,How much did the ribbon I bought with Michiyo[r]cost...?[l][p]
d1_030_0258,490 yen... That's right![l][p]
d1_030_0259,Well, it seems we have the right spirit...[l][p]
d1_030_0260,Okay... Can I have you ask her a question?[l][p]
d1_030_0261,Okay.[r]What do you want me to ask her?[l][p]
d1_030_0262,I want you to ask about the location of[r]Fumichika Nejima's hideout and...[l][p]
d1_030_0263,The location of the talisman as well.[l][p]
d1_030_0264,Okay![l][p]
d1_030_0265,Say goodbye.
d1_030_0266,Where is Fumichika Nejima's hideout?
d1_030_0267,Where is the talisman?
d1_030_0268,Who was responsible for the hit-and-run?
d1_030_0269,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d1_030_0270,Please tell me the location of Fumichika[r]Nejima's hideout![l][p]
d1_030_0271,Please! Terrible things will happen if he[r]isn't captured soon![l][p]
d1_030_0272,I'm sure it's painful to try and remember...[l][p]
d1_030_0273,But you're the only one who can help us, Michiyo![l][p]
d1_030_0274,Please![l][p]
d1_030_0275,It moved![l][p]
d1_030_0276,This is... An [c3]address[c0]![r]She's giving us the address![l][p]
d1_030_0277,Amazing...[r]Thank you, Michiyo![l][p]
d1_030_0278,...Okay. I have the address![r]Thank you![l][p]
d1_030_0279,All right, Erio![r]Get a move on and check out that address![l][p]
d1_030_0280,Yessir! I'll contact HQ and order a simultaneous[r]house search and sweep of the area![l][p]
d1_030_0281,I just hope the information is accurate...[l][p]
d1_030_0282,I know it is![l][p]
d1_030_0283,I've already asked about this.[r]I should ask another question.[l][p]
d1_030_0284,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d1_030_0285,Do you know where the talisman that you had is...?[l][p]
d1_030_0286,She does know...[l][p]
d1_030_0287,I wonder if we can find a way to narrow it down...[l][p]
d1_030_0288,I'll try asking.[l][p]
d1_030_0289,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board, did you carry[r]around the talisman with you at all times?[l][p]
d1_030_0290,So she did carry it with her...[l][p]
d1_030_0291,Then... Did you have it with you when you had[r]your accident?[l][p]
d1_030_0292,Huh...? She had it with her![l][p]
d1_030_0293,But... There was nothing resembling a talisman[r]in the articles left behind at the scene...[l][p]
d1_030_0294,So that means someone took it with them and ran[r]off with it before the scene was investigated...?[l][p]
d1_030_0295,But who would do that?[l][p]
d1_030_0296,This would mean someone knew Michiyo had died[r]before the police did...[l][p]
d1_030_0297,The first person to discover and report it was[r]the caretaker of the apartment building next[r]door. Should we check with them?[l][p]
d1_030_0298,Let's see...[l][p]
d1_030_0299,The other possibility I can think of is...[l][p]
d1_030_0300,The perpetrator of the hit-and-run?[l][p]
d1_030_0301,But it was a hit-and-run.[r]Wouldn't they have run away?[l][p]
d1_030_0302,It might be possible they came back.[r]Driven by fear, or something else.[l][p]
d1_030_0303,Even if so, they didn't report it and went through[r]her belongings.[l][p]
d1_030_0304,But to only take the talisman? Seems hard to[r]believe.[l][p]
d1_030_0305,Unless they were after the talisman from the very[r]beginning.[l][p]
d1_030_0306,How likely is that?[r]If the talisman really is so special...[l][p]
d1_030_0307,Erio mentioned the same thing, but to run someone[r]over just to take something from them?[l][p]
d1_030_0308,It's possible they just picked up the talisman[r]after hitting her for no particular reason.[l][p]
d1_030_0309,Either way, if it really was a hit-and-run, then[r]I hope they get caught.[l][p]
d1_030_0310,It's possible she remembers something after[r]seeing that picture of the car.[l][p]
d1_030_0311,Then... Shall we try asking?[l][p]
d1_030_0312,I'll try.[l][p]
d1_030_0313,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d1_030_0314,Do you know who was behind the hit-and-run?[l][p]
d1_030_0315,She says she knows...![l][p]
d1_030_0316,That's a relief...[r]If she hadn't known...[l][p]
d1_030_0317,Huh...?[l][p]
d1_030_0318,In order for Michiyo's spirit to find peace, we need[r]as much detailed information about what happened[r]as possible.[l][p]
d1_030_0319,We can't send her off to the afterlife if we don't[r]know what happened when she died.[l][p]
d1_030_0320,This isn't like a forced exorcism.[l][p]
d1_030_0321,Huh, so that's what it'll take...[l][p]
d1_030_0322,All right... I'll try asking.[l][p]
d1_030_0323,Right.[l][p]
d1_030_0324,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d1_030_0325,Who was the one who...ran you over?[l][p]
d1_030_0326,I hope she knows the name...[l][p]
d1_030_0327,I wonder...[l][p]
d1_030_0328,N...a...m...i...g...a...k...i?[l][p]
d1_030_0329,Huh...? Namigaki...?
d1_030_0330,What!?[l][p]
d1_030_0331,You mean, Yutaro Namigaki!?[r]You two know him?[l][p]
d1_030_0332,We talked with him after we left the cafe.[r]He used to be a curse bearer, right?[l][p]
d1_030_0333,Ah, I see... So that's why Yakko had that reaction[r]when she saw him.[l][p]
d1_030_0334,What...?[l][p]
d1_030_0335,Come to think of it, that guy said he wanted[r]to talk about Michiyo![l][p]
d1_030_0336,What...?[r]The hell is he planning without his curse stone?[l][p]
d1_030_0337,He said he'd be waiting near Ryogoku Bridge...[l][p]
d1_030_0338,Got it. I'll join you there once we're done.[l][p]
d1_030_0339,He's the bastard who killed Michiyo...?[l][p]
d1_030_0340,Yakko...[l][p]
d1_030_0341,This should be enough information...[l][p]
d1_030_0342,We can release Michiyo from her suffering now.[r]Let's do it.[l][p]
d1_030_0343,...All right.[l][p]
d1_030_0344,Oh, Specter of the Spirit Board.[l][p]
d1_030_0345,No...[r]Michiyo.[l][p]
d1_030_0346,Thank you. You helped us.[l][p]
d1_030_0347,...You know?[l][p]
d1_030_0348,I'm so sorry I didn't know about it all.[r]Your family, the kidnapping, Mr. Jonouchi...[l][p]
d1_030_0349,I'm so sorry...[l][p]
d1_030_0350,It must have been so hard...[l][p]
d1_030_0351,Not that I could understand.[r]But I'm sure it was so hard...[l][p]
d1_030_0352,...[l][p]
d1_030_0353,I mean... Of course you would want revenge![r]I wanted it, too![l][p]
d1_030_0354,We've all done things that we wish we could take[r]back...[l][p]
d1_030_0355,But...I'm glad that I at least know the truth.[l][p]
d1_030_0356,Yakko...[l][p]
d1_030_0357,There's so much I want to say, but...[r]That's enough.[l][p]
d1_030_0358,Let me just ask you one last thing.[l][p]
d1_030_0359,Someday...[l][p]
d1_030_0360,Can we hang out again?[l][p]
d1_030_0361,You mean it?[r]Okay! It's a promise![l][p]
d1_030_0362,...[l][p]
d1_030_0363,Have you...asked everything you wanted?[l][p]
d1_030_0364,...[l][p]
d1_030_0365,...Yeah.[l][p]
d1_030_0366,Okay.[r]I'm going to guide Michiyo's spirit now.[l][p]
d1_030_0367,...Yeah. It's time to say goodbye.[l][p]
d1_030_0368,Michiyo...[r]With this, I'll finally be able to free you...[l][p]
d1_030_0369,Hey, Yakko?[l][p]
d1_030_0370,Yeah?[l][p]
d1_030_0371,You never accepted the idea that Michiyo took[r]her own life.[l][p]
d1_030_0372,I'm glad you never stopped trying to find[r]the truth.[l][p]
d1_030_0373,...Yeah.[l][p]
d1_030_0374,You're right.[l][p]
d1_030_0375,Even though I didn't realize just how hard[r]things were for her...[l][p]
d1_030_0376,Mio...?[l][p]
d1_030_0377,Sorry...[l][p]
d1_030_0378,It's just... Michiyo...[l][p]
d1_030_0379,She was taken advantage of by so many of the[r]adults around her... She put up with so much...[l][p]
d1_030_0380,I should have tried and talk with her more...[l][p]
d1_030_0381,I know how you feel...[r]Thanks, Mio.[l][p]
d1_030_0382,It hurts thinking about all of the things I could[r]have done...[l][p]
d1_030_0383,Why did this have to happen to someone so[r]kind and hardworking?[l][p]
d1_030_0384,It feels like she was ill-fated to the very end...[r]It's just too cruel.[l][p]
d1_030_0385,But even then...[l][p]
d1_030_0386,She didn't even tell me about this stuff.[l][p]
d1_030_0387,And she let herself worry more about revenge[r]than living. I'm mad at her for that![l][p]
d1_030_0388,Sure, I should have noticed something was wrong...[r]But come on![l][p]
d1_030_0389,Ugh! What was she thinking!? Seriously! I mean,[r]seriously![l][p]
d1_030_0390,Am I really that unreliable?[l][p]
d1_030_0391,Of course I'd help you get your revenge,[r]you idiot![l][p]
d1_030_0392,I don't care how you had changed or whatever![r]I just wanted you to live![l][p]
d1_030_0393,Yakko...[l][p]
d1_030_0394,I'll take responsibility for what's been done...[l][p]
d1_030_0395,But one day, if we meet on the other side...[l][p]
d1_030_0396,I'm gonna have to give her a good punch! Then[r]I'll tell her she's the real Fool's Procession![r]...Or something.[l][p]
d1_030_0397,Then we'll hang out like always.[l][p]
d1_030_0398,Hehe... Sounds like fun.[l][p]
d1_030_0399,All right. I'm sending her off, okay?[l][p]
d1_030_0400,Oh, wait![l][p]
d1_030_0401,...?[l][p]
d1_030_0402,Look, the coin...[r]It moved to "No" all on its own...[l][p]
d1_030_0403,You're right...[r]When did it do that...?[l][p]
d1_030_0404,It seems she still has something keeping her here.[l][p]
d1_030_0405,Yakko, do you have any idea about what Michiyo[r]wants...?[l][p]
d1_030_0406,Me...?[l][p]
d1_030_0407,...Oh![l][p]
d1_030_0408,[s0.1][a0.5]Please... Don't forget me...
d1_030_0409,I think she told me that she didn't want me to[r]forget.[l][p]
d1_030_0410,I see...[r]Then...[l][p]
d1_030_0411,Michiyo?[l][p]
d1_030_0412,If you can hear my voice...[l][p]
d1_030_0413,Let your feelings that you won't ever forget her[r]be known...[l][p]
d1_030_0414,Show it through an action.[l][p]
d1_030_0415,What...?[l][p]
d1_030_0416,[s0][a0.5][x0.7]Do something that shows you won't forget.
d1_030_0417,If you would like to wait to finish this section,[r]you may return to the Story Chart now.[r]You will be able play this scene again.
d1_030_0418,[s0.1][a0.5]Thank you...
d1_030_0419,[s0.1][a0.5]Though... I don't really want you to punch me,[r]so live a long life, okay?
d1_030_0420,[s0.1][a0.5]I'll see you later...
d1_030_0421,Komagata High School
d1_030_0422,Ryogoku Bridge
d1_030_0423,Yakko.[r]Are you feeling alright...?[l][p]
d1_030_0424,Yeah, I'm fine.[r]Actually, I feel a lot better.[l][p]
d1_030_0425,I guess I really wasn't feeling like myself[r]recently.[l][p]
d1_030_0426,It was like there was a part of me that I had no[r]control of or something?[l][p]
d1_030_0427,Yeah. I think you're back to your normal self now.[r]I'm glad there weren't any problems.[l][p]
d1_030_0428,I wonder if Michiyo was able to find peace...?[l][p]
d1_030_0429,I know she did.[r]You don't have to worry about that.[l][p]
d1_030_0430,It seems that her regret was not being able to[r]tell you what was going on and growing apart[r]from you.[l][p]
d1_030_0431,Well... I guess I can forgive her for that...[l][p]
d1_030_0432,But... There's still something bothering me...[l][p]
d1_030_0433,Really?[l][p]
d1_030_0434,Yeah... I wonder what this feeling is?[l][p]
d1_030_0435,It's like there's a piece of her that hasn't[r]left yet.[l][p]
d1_030_0436,Hmm... It may be an after-effect.[l][p]
d1_030_0437,Maybe because you gave your stone to Chief[r]Inspector Tsutsumi?[l][p]
d1_030_0438,Doubt it. Having a curse stone shouldn't have[r]any effect on your body.[l][p]
d1_030_0439,But dealing with four curses sounds like a lot[r]of stress! Good work, Chief![l][p]
d1_030_0440,Someone's like a completely different person[r]all of a sudden...[l][p]
d1_030_0441,But...are you really sure about this? Having us[r]arrest you once this is all over.[l][p]
d1_030_0442,You might be able to get your case treated[r]as just an accident...[l][p]
d1_030_0443,It's fine! Treat me the same as someone who[r]used a curse stone to kill someone![l][p]
d1_030_0444,If anything, I should be thanking you for letting[r]me go free until this is all over! So thanks,[r]Chief![l][p]

d1_030_0447,Whoa, whoa...[r]You didn't say anything about bringing the police![l][p]
d1_030_0448,Sorry, but we don't have time to care about[r]what you have to say about us.[l][p]
d1_030_0449,What business do you have with this girl now that[r]you've lost your curse stone?[l][p]
d1_030_0450,I'll tell you this for free. I have her curse[r]stone already.[l][p]
d1_030_0451,Ngh...![l][p]
d1_030_0452,Talk
d1_030_0453,Yutaro Namigaki
d1_030_0454,Tetsuo Tsutsumi
d1_030_0455,!
d1_030_0456,Think
d1_030_0457,Yutaro's visibly shaken. That must mean there's[r]some reason he doesn't want the cops around.[l][p]
d1_030_0458,The chief makes some weird jokes sometimes,[r]but still, it's reassuring to have a veteran[r]policeman with us.[l][p]
d1_030_0459,I...don't have any ill intentions.[l][p]
d1_030_0460,I wanted to tell you that... I want to help if[r]you intend to resurrect Michiyo Shiraishi.[l][p]
d1_030_0461,That was my intention from the beginning when[r]I received my curse stone.[l][p]
d1_030_0462,And that's why I took your curse stone.[r]Man, can't be too careful.[l][p]
d1_030_0463,Besides, what connection do you have to Michiyo[r]Shiraishi?[l][p]
d1_030_0464,We, um...met once.[l][p]
d1_030_0465,I was so sad to hear the news of her death[r]the other day.[l][p]
d1_030_0466,Uh-huh...[l][p]
d1_030_0467,Met once...!?[l][p]
d1_030_0468,I see. Well, I'm sure it must have been painful[r]for you, but...[l][p]
d1_030_0469,Do you think bringing back the dead will erase[r]the fact that you hit her with your car?
d1_030_0470,Wha—!?[l][p]
d1_030_0471,I'm sure that I have no idea what you're[r]talking about.[l][p]
d1_030_0472,Well... Leave this to me, okay?[l][p]
d1_030_0473,We should let him take care of this.[l][p]
d1_030_0474,There's a lot of traffic around here and it's[r]very noisy during the day.[l][p]
d1_030_0475,The amount of exhaust coming from cars is[r]overwhelming. I hear it's not healthy.[l][p]
d1_030_0476,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori11 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #11[c0] discovered!
d1_030_0477,<i>This is the bastard who ran over Michiyo[r]and drove away...?[l][p]
d1_030_0478,<i>If that's true...then why does he...?[l][p]
d1_030_0479,<i>Oh... So he thinks he can undo what he's done[r]by bringing back Michiyo.[l][p]
d1_030_0480,<i>What a selfish reason... But in the end would I[r]be opposed to that...?[l][p]
d1_030_0481,<i>I don't know... What would I have thought[r]if I met him last night?[l][p]
d1_030_0482,If you don't know...I'll tell you. And you'll[r]let me ask you some questions in return.[l][p]
d1_030_0483,Hrk...![l][p]
d1_030_0484,Did you just get your license recently? Hm?[l][p]
d1_030_0485,We found a van with bloodstains on it, you see...[r]It's only a matter of time before we find who[r]the owner is.[l][p]
d1_030_0486,Wh-what's that supposed to mean!?[l][p]
d1_030_0487,Why don't you tell me a little bit more about your[r]relationship with Michiyo Shiraishi?[l][p]
d1_030_0488,Not only that... You killed someone with your curse[r]stone, didn't you?[l][p]
d1_030_0489,Stop! Stay away from me![l][p]
d1_030_0490,Damn it...[l][p]
d1_030_0491,Okay, okay... I give up.[l][p]
d1_030_0492,Ah...[r]It's all over for me![l][p]
d1_030_0493,Afterwards, Yutaro Namigaki gave his confession.[l][p]
d1_030_0494,He admitted that he was behind the wheel of the[r]van that hit Michiyo Shiraishi.[l][p]
d1_030_0495,He explained that he was speeding in order to[r]impress a girl he had in the car with him.[l][p]
d1_030_0496,After hitting the schoolgirl, he drove away and[r]planned to wash the car in secret to destroy the[r]evidence.[l][p]
d1_030_0497,But he became nervous and went back to the scene[r]of the crime at the urging of his passenger.[l][p]
d1_030_0498,When they returned to the scene, the female[r]passenger went to check the victim alone while[r]he sat panicking in the car.[l][p]
d1_030_0499,When she returned, she told him people were[r]unlikely to assume a hit-and-run, as it looked[r]similar to a suicide by jumping from height.[l][p]
d1_030_0500,Afterwards, the pair parted ways and Yutaro[r]dumped the vehicle deep in the woods under the[r]cover of night.[l][p]
d1_030_0501,The two of them decided to keep the accident a[r]secret.[l][p]
d1_030_0502,The next morning, Michiyo Shiraishi's body was[r]discovered and, luckily for them, her death was[r]ruled a suicide.[l][p]
d1_030_0503,However, a darkness lingered within his heart...[l][p]
d1_030_0504,From that day on, the schoolgirl appeared[r]before him covered in blood, her limbs bent and[r]broken, to spite him in his dreams every night.[l][p]
d1_030_0505,Even when awake, he would see a phantom of her[r]corpse in the dark, moaning and cursing him at all[r]times.[l][p]
d1_030_0506,Troubled by the constant hallucinations, it was[r]only a number of days before he suffered a[r]nervous breakdown.[l][p]
d1_030_0507,He couldn't bear hiding what he'd done anymore,[r]and planned to turn himself in, but was stopped[r]by the passenger from that night.[l][p]
d1_030_0508,It was then that he first heard rumors of the[r]Rite of Resurrection.[l][p]
d1_030_0509,He thought that if he could resurrect the[r]schoolgirl, that it would be like if the accident[r]never happened.[l][p]
d1_030_0510,And with that, the darkness enshrouding his[r]heart could be dissipated.[l][p]
d1_030_0511,From then on, he searched the areas associated[r]with the Seven Mysteries of Honjo every night.[l][p]
d1_030_0512,And he received the curse of the Foot-Washing[r]Mansion as a result.[l][p]
d1_030_0513,I see...[l][p]
d1_030_0514,That's right! I'm not a bad man! I wanted to turn[r]myself in! It was that girl who tempted me...![l][p]
d1_030_0515,Okay, okay. Calm down and listen, son.[l][p]
d1_030_0516,If you don't think you've done anything wrong...[r]What would these girls think if they saw you run[r]over that poor girl?[l][p]
d1_030_0517,Ngh...[l][p]
d1_030_0518,There's something I want to know.[l][p]
d1_030_0519,Do you know anything about a talisman that[r]Michiyo should have had on her at the time of[r]the accident?[l][p]
d1_030_0520,Talisman? What are you talking about?[l][p]
d1_030_0521,Hmm, so you don't know anything...[l][p]
d1_030_0522,In that case, what about that woman who was with[r]you? Can you ask her?[l][p]
d1_030_0523,Oh... That's right...[r]Everything is her fault in the first place.[l][p]
d1_030_0524,Well... That may not be exactly wrong...[l][p]
d1_030_0525,Just riding passenger in a car involved in an[r]involuntary vehicular manslaughter isn't a[r]crime in and of itself.[l][p]
d1_030_0526,But according to your statement, she neglected[r]her duty to seek aid and instigated you to[r]neglect your duty to report the accident.[l][p]
d1_030_0527,And if she took an article from the scene,[r]she'd also be charged with theft...[l][p]
d1_030_0528,Can you tell me who she is? You have no intent[r]of hiding anything anymore, do you?[l][p]
d1_030_0529,Yeah, that's right. It's her fault. Do what you[r]want with her, it's time for her to face what[r]she's done.[l][p]
d1_030_0530,...Her name is [c4]Ayame Tono[c0]. She's an art student I[r]met in town.[l][p]
d1_030_0531,What!?[l][p]
d1_030_0532,An art student named Ayame Tono!?[l][p]
d1_030_0533,Whoa, whoa, whoa![r]Are you absolutely sure of that?[l][p]
d1_030_0534,What point would there be in lying to you now?[r]What, do you know her or something?[l][p]
d1_030_0535,She may look nice, but she's rotten on the[r]inside... I'd like to meet the parents who raised[r]someone like that.[l][p]
d1_030_0536,Shut up![l][p]
d1_030_0537,...?[l][p]
d1_030_0538,What's wrong, Inspector Tsutsumi?[r]You're drenched in sweat...[l][p]
d1_030_0539,Ahh... No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait![l][p]
d1_030_0540,Damn it! Why!? How could this happen!?[l][p]
d1_030_0541,Listen up! I'm taking this one with me down to[r]the station for more questioning![l][p]
d1_030_0542,You two go after the Record of Fates Yin Scroll,[r]got that?[l][p]
d1_030_0543,Uh...[r]Okay. We will![l][p]
d1_030_0544,Come with me![l][p]
d1_030_0545,Whoa![l][p]
d1_030_0546,Um...[l][p]
d1_030_0547,...Let's get going.[l][p]
d1_030_0548,...Yeah.[l][p]

d1_035_0009,So...? What did you want to discuss with us?[l][p]
d1_035_0010,Let's see, how do I put this...[l][p]
d1_035_0011,I'll tell you straight.[l][p]
d1_035_0012,I want you two to use your curse stones[r]to bring Michiyo Shiraishi back from the dead.
d1_035_0013,What...?[l][p]
d1_035_0014,……!?[l][p]
d1_035_0015,It's why I was pursuing the Rite of Resurrection[r]in the first place.[l][p]
d1_035_0016,Unfortunately, I had to give up my curse stone[r]before I could succeed.[l][p]
d1_035_0017,But you two are curse bearers with some kind[r]of connection to her.[l][p]
d1_035_0018,Which means this is the perfect opportunity for[r]me to ask you for this.[l][p]
d1_035_0019,Um, well...[l][p]
d1_035_0020,I'm sorry, this is all so sudden, I still don't[r]understand why you would want this...[l][p]
d1_035_0021,What exactly is your relationship with Michiyo?[l][p]
d1_035_0022,Well, we met briefly once.[l][p]
d1_035_0023,I was so sad to hear the news of her death[r]the other day.[l][p]
d1_035_0024,Right...[l][p]
d1_035_0025,While it would be great if we could bring Michiyo[r]back...[l][p]
d1_035_0026,But we've already decided not to use the Rite[r]of Resurrection.[l][p]
d1_035_0027,Is that so...[l][p]
d1_035_0028,It seems, however, that we share a goal.[l][p]
d1_035_0029,I wouldn't mind collecting the soul dregs for you[r]if you gave me your curse stone, you know?[l][p]
d1_035_0030,We'll have to decline that as well. Our goal is[r]to stop this curse.[l][p]
d1_035_0031,...[l][p]
d1_035_0032,I see... Well, that's too bad. I suppose I'll[r]have to give up on the curse stones.[l][p]
d1_035_0033,Thank you for understanding.[l][p]
d1_035_0034,Phew... I thought he was a little suspicious,[r]but he left without making a fuss.[l][p]
d1_035_0035,But why does he want to bring Michiyo back...?[l][p]
d1_035_0036,Huh? Yakko...?
d1_035_0037,Uh oh! Did she go off somewhere while we[r]were talking?[l][p]
d1_035_0038,Heh... I've finally caught up to you.[l][p]
d1_035_0039,I don't know if you noticed me following you[r]or not.[l][p]
d1_035_0040,But leading me to a secluded place?[r]You've got guts.[l][p]
d1_035_0041,...[l][p]
d1_035_0042,I'm sorry, but I'll be taking your curse stone.[l][p]
d1_035_0043,Either you hand it over, or I'll have to[r]take it by force.[l][p]
d1_035_0044,Wha—!?[l][p]
d1_035_0045,Wh-why!? Are you—[l][p]
d1_035_0046,No, no, no! She's here again! I don't understand![l][p]
d1_035_0047,Ah... Aaaaaah! Wait![r]It was just an accident![l][p]
d1_035_0048,I swear! I didn't mean to![l][p]
d1_035_0049,Th-that's why I was trying to bring you back![l][p]

d1_040_0027,Has Mio been doing stuff like this all by herself[r]up until now?[l][p]
d1_040_0028,It's so dangerous, and there are so many[r]unknowns... Must be so tough for her.[l][p]
d1_040_0029,No wonder it'd be hard to make friends.[l][p]
d1_040_0030,Hm? Something the matter?[l][p]
d1_040_0031,Nope. Let's go for it![l][p]
d1_040_0032,I'm sure we'll be fine. I mean, we've managed[r]to get this far.[l][p]
d1_040_0033,Hey, Mio. You know...[l][p]
d1_040_0034,Yeah?[l][p]
d1_040_0035,You might not look it, but you've got a bold[r]side. A little reckless, even.[l][p]
d1_040_0036,Huh? You think?[l][p]
d1_040_0037,I suppose... Things not going to plan is just a[r]part of life in this world.[l][p]
d1_040_0038,No, I mean I think it's a good thing! I'm the same[r]way![l][p]
d1_040_0039,I feel like we get along well together.[r]Maybe that's one reason why.[l][p]
d1_040_0040,Oh... Yeah. Thanks.[r]...Heheh.[l][p]
d1_040_0041,So this is the Hihaku Soaps headquarters...[l][p]
d1_040_0042,So we're thinking that one of the high-ranking[r]people here is most likely the mastermind.[l][p]
d1_040_0043,Chairwoman...Yamamori, was it?[l][p]
d1_040_0044,Wait, are chairwomen high-ranking? Isn't the[r]most important person at a company the president?[l][p]
d1_040_0045,Hm, I'm not sure... But she's definitely an[r]important person.[l][p]
d1_040_0046,Even if we're able to meet with her, what do we[r]talk with her about?[l][p]
d1_040_0047,We can't just waltz in there and ask her if she[r]knows about the Yin Scroll out of nowhere.[l][p]
d1_040_0048,Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained,[r]as they say...[l][p]
d1_040_0049,Ooh. Is that your working style, Mio?[l][p]
d1_040_0050,Err, well, whenever I find myself out of options,[r]I usually just jump right into the thick of it...[l][p]
d1_040_0051,Oh. If you're scared, I don't mind going in by[r]myself.[l][p]
d1_040_0052,Scared? As if! Think of me as your trusty[r]bodyguard.[l][p]
d1_040_0053,I don't mind going big and taking a chance![l][p]
d1_040_0054,Oh... Yeah. There's the Yakko I know.[l][p]
d1_040_0055,Now, shall we?[l][p]
d1_040_0056,Go inside
d1_040_0057,Wait
d1_040_0058,Sorry, hold on just a minute![l][p]
d1_040_0059,No problem. We can take our time.[l][p]
d1_040_0060,All right! Let's give this a shot![l][p]
d1_040_0061,Um, excuse us...[l][p]
d1_040_0062,Looks like were out of luck...[l][p]
d1_040_0063,Who knew you needed an appointment months in[r]advance to meet a chairwoman...[l][p]
d1_040_0064,Turns out she's super-duper important...[l][p]
d1_040_0065,Even the receptionist gave us the cold shoulder[r]after realizing we're just students.[l][p]
d1_040_0066,Maybe her private secretary would hear us out,[r]but they seem to be out at the moment.[l][p]
d1_040_0067,Hmm, in that case...[l][p]
d1_040_0068,If Hihaku was no good, I don't know if we have[r]any other options...[l][p]

d1_040_0070,Oh, Mio. What about that one guy?[l][p]
d1_040_0071,The one Inspector Tsutsumi checked with...[r]I forget his name.[l][p]
d1_040_0072,Oh, right...[r]Apparently he never heard from Nakagoshi.[l][p]
d1_040_0073,Not that we have a way of contacting him[r]directly anyway.[l][p]
d1_040_0074,We'd just have to leave a message with the[r]Paranormal Affairs Bureau's messenger and hope it[r]reaches him.[l][p]
d1_040_0075,He's always the one who contacts me...[r]And even then it's only instructions.[l][p]
d1_040_0076,Hm... Well I guess we're in a tight spot then.[l][p]
d1_040_0077,We won't get anywhere just waiting around.[r]Let's do the best we can working on our own.[l][p]
d1_040_0078,In which case, is waiting for her secretary the[r]only thing we can do...?[l][p]
d1_040_0079,There were a bunch of police cars speeding by[r]here earlier...[l][p]
d1_040_0080,I wonder if something happened.[l][p]
d1_040_0081,Must be. I've seen a few police officers and they[r]looked like they were on edge.[l][p]
d1_040_0082,Could Inspector Tsutsumi have let that Nejima[r]escape and everyone's scrambling to find him...?[l][p]
d1_040_0083,Oh... After all the effort we put into gathering[r]information, that would be unfortunate...[l][p]
d1_040_0084,<i>Now then... Can we really just barge in there[r]and expect it to go well?[l][p]
d1_040_0085,<i>Barging in suddenly didn't work out...[l][p]

d1_040_0091,What, that tall guy? Do you know him?[l][p]
d1_040_0092,Yeah. From a little while back...[l][p]
d1_040_0093,Mr. Yumioka, over here![l][p]
d1_040_0094,Hm...?[l][p]
d1_040_0095,Oh![l][p]
d1_040_0096,You're Gamyodo's manager, Mr. Yumioka, yes?[r]Good to see you again.[l][p]
d1_040_0097,M-Miss Kurosuzu...![l][p]
d1_040_0098,What a coincidence, running into you here.[l][p]
d1_040_0099,Gamyodo...? Yumioka...?[l][p]
d1_040_0100,Takumi Yumioka
d1_040_0101,He's been trying to avoid eye contact with Mio[r]since he noticed it was her.[l][p]
d1_040_0102,Something's fishy.[l][p]
d1_040_0103,Like he's a little too nervous for just running[r]into an acquaintance...[l][p]
d1_040_0104,How have things been since we last met?[l][p]
d1_040_0105,If she just stays with her training, she won't have[r]to rely on cheating people anymore.[l][p]
d1_040_0106,Yes... She has been...keeping at it...[l][p]
d1_040_0107,Cheating people?[l][p]
d1_040_0108,M-Miss Kurosuzu, so glad to see you are doing[r]well. I assure you we've had no issues you need[r]concern yourself with.[l][p]
d1_040_0109,You know him, Mio?[l][p]
d1_040_0110,Yeah. From a job a while back.[l][p]
d1_040_0111,You gotta tell me what happened.[l][p]
d1_040_0112,A case from a while back. A family overseeing a[r]reliquary came to us saying they were being[r]investigated by someone suspicious.[l][p]
d1_040_0113,Investigated...?[l][p]
d1_040_0114,A psychic named Suigen Gamyodo suddenly[r]showed up...[l][p]
d1_040_0115,She said that she had a premonition that something[r]terrible would happen, and had to exorcise the[r]temple immediately.[l][p]
d1_040_0116,Sounds like a cover for a burglary.[l][p]
d1_040_0117,After they notified the police, I was dispatched[r]there by Paranormal Affairs.[l][p]
d1_040_0118,I inspected the place myself but didn't see[r]anything wrong, so I sent them away.[l][p]
d1_040_0119,He acted as Gamyodo's manager during the case.[l][p]
d1_040_0120,That is pretty suspicious...[l][p]
d1_040_0121,Apparently she was looking for something there,[r]but I told her that's no excuse for fraud and sent[r]her off with a scolding.[l][p]
d1_040_0122,And honestly... Gamyodo didn't even have much[r]spirit sense to speak of, which soured my mood[r]on the whole thing.[l][p]
d1_040_0123,Right, so she was one of those types then?[l][p]
d1_040_0124,Well, she's involved in all kinds of stuff, so she[r]may at least be knowledgeable about paranormal[r]objects...[l][p]
d1_040_0125,But essentially, she's one of those fraudulent[r]psychics that are so common nowadays.[l][p]
d1_040_0126,<i>Just what kind of person is this guy...?[l][p]
d1_040_0127,<i>He hasn't made eye contact with Mio this whole[r]time...[l][p]
d1_040_0128,<i>Hate is radiating off of him. He really doesn't[r]like Mio...[l][p]
d1_040_0129,If you have no further business with me, then[r]I'll be on my—[l][p]
d1_040_0130,Oh, before you go.[l][p]
d1_040_0131,Gamyodo seemed to know a lot about paranormal[r]objects, it would be a huge help if we could ask[r]her about something.[l][p]
d1_040_0132,...And what might that be?[l][p]
d1_040_0133,Is she familiar with an ancient text called the[r]Record of Fates Yin Scroll?[l][p]
d1_040_0134,Or anything about the descendants of a onmyoji[r]named Seiman Tsuchimikado.[l][p]
d1_040_0135,...I beg your pardon?[l][p]
d1_040_0136,Miss Kurosuzu...how do you...?[l][p]
d1_040_0137,So you do know about it?[l][p]
d1_040_0138,I see. If that's what you're after, then that[r]means...[l][p]
d1_040_0139,Hold it! Don't tell me you're trying to snatch[r]up some innocent schoolgirls this time!?[r]Stop right there![l][p]
d1_040_0140,Huh?[l][p]
d1_040_0141,If it isn't Yumioka. What a pleasure to see you[r]again.[l][p]
d1_040_0142,Wha—!? Mayu Chozawa! What are you doing here!?[l][p]
d1_040_0143,Huh...? Chozawa!?[l][p]
d1_040_0144,This investigator here helped me out. You really[r]did a number on me.[l][p]
d1_040_0145,What do you know, we just so happen to have some[r]business with Hihaku ourselves.[l][p]
d1_040_0146,Why don't you join us?[l][p]
d1_040_0147,You can do that much for us, can't you? You work[r]for Hihaku, after all.[l][p]
d1_040_0148,Depending on how this conversation goes, I won't[r]have to get the police involved.[l][p]
d1_040_0149,Huh...? You work for Hihaku!?[l][p]
d1_040_0150,What's going on...?[l][p]
d1_040_0151,...[l][p]
d1_040_0152,There's really no way you can refuse, though,[r]is there?[l][p]
d1_040_0153,You two young ladies must be involved as well.[r]Would you care to join us?[l][p]
d1_040_0154,Oh... Um... Sure.[l][p]
d1_040_0155,Quite the view, isn't it?[l][p]
d1_040_0156,How long can you play dumb with this many people[r]lined up and wanting answers from you?[l][p]
d1_040_0157,You'd better just give in and come clean with[r]everything you know.[l][p]
d1_040_0158,Urgh...[l][p]
d1_040_0159,Richter Kai
d1_040_0160,Mayu Chozawa
d1_040_0161,The Client
d1_040_0162,He's clearly shaken by all this.[l][p]
d1_040_0163,It feels like he's desperately racking his brain[r]for a way to get out of this. It's almost hard[r]to watch...[l][p]
d1_040_0164,She's Mayu Chozawa, the fiancée of Hajime[r]Yoshimi, the police officer.[l][p]
d1_040_0165,I'll have to talk to her about Hitomi later.[l][p]
d1_040_0166,We were introduced briefly earlier, but this[r]flashy looking guy is a private investigator.[l][p]
d1_040_0167,I thought they were only like that in TV shows,[r]but I guess they're pretty intense in real life[r]too.[l][p]
d1_040_0168,She was only introduced as the investigator's[r]client...[l][p]
d1_040_0169,She's...cool. It feels like we wouldn't stand a[r]chance against a full-grown woman like her.[l][p]
d1_040_0170,But Mio is amazing too, keeping her cool at a[r]time like this.[l][p]
d1_040_0171,She must be used to dealing with adults by now.[l][p]
d1_040_0172,Urgh... Haah... Haah...[l][p]
d1_040_0173,I'll cut to the chase, then.[l][p]
d1_040_0174,Are you the ones who killed Hajime Yoshimi?[l][p]
d1_040_0175,...No, we did not.[l][p]
d1_040_0176,Don't try and play dumb, now![r]If not you, then who!?[l][p]
d1_040_0177,That much, I don't know.[l][p]
d1_040_0178,While it is true that we were after the[r]information he possessed...[l][p]
d1_040_0179,He was killed by someone else before we could[r]acquire it.[l][p]
d1_040_0180,Which forced us to target you instead,[r]Ms. Chozawa.[l][p]
d1_040_0181,Tch...[l][p]
d1_040_0182,And that's why you forced me to talk and why[r]I ended up with this curse, huh?[l][p]
d1_040_0183,Indeed.[r]Though I never thought you would escape...[l][p]
d1_040_0184,Well, it took a couple of miracles, but yeah,[r]I got out.[l][p]
d1_040_0185,And just what information did Hajime have that[r]you wanted?[l][p]
d1_040_0186,Mmh...[l][p]
d1_040_0187,You really think you can get away without[r]answering now?[l][p]
d1_040_0188,But...[l][p]
d1_040_0189,Tch...[l][p]
d1_040_0190,Fine. I'll let someone else ask you something[r]for now.[l][p]
d1_040_0191,Now then, I've come to hand over the Haunting[r]Clappers curse stone like I promised.[l][p]
d1_040_0192,A curse stone...?[l][p]
d1_040_0193,Thank you. I have to admit, I'm surprised that[r]you are a man of your word.[l][p]
d1_040_0194,But first, I've got some questions about the curse[r]stones you already have.[l][p]
d1_040_0195,...What exactly do you want to know?[l][p]
d1_040_0196,Earlier you said that Hihaku have collected six[r]curse stones already.[l][p]
d1_040_0197,Six!?[l][p]
d1_040_0198,I'd like to confirm which of the Seven Mysteries[r]they correspond to.[l][p]
d1_040_0199,And why do you need to know that?[l][p]
d1_040_0200,Because I don't trust, of course.[l][p]
d1_040_0201,If you really collected them like you say, you'd[r]have no problem saying which curse stones they[r]are, right?[l][p]
d1_040_0202,...[l][p]
d1_040_0203,First... The Whispering Canal.[l][p]
d1_040_0204,Good, good. And what else?[l][p]
d1_040_0205,Mayu Chozawa over there has the Beckoning Light.[l][p]
d1_040_0206,Yep. You were the one who made sure I got it.[l][p]
d1_040_0207,What...?[l][p]
d1_040_0208,Unfortunately for you, I don't feel like handing[r]it over.[l][p]
d1_040_0209,So I don't think it counts as one of yours.[l][p]
d1_040_0210,Hrk...[l][p]
d1_040_0211,Good to know. Anyway, do continue.[l][p]
d1_040_0212,Next there's the Everburning Lantern which we[r]gave to Hideki Araishi...[l][p]
d1_040_0213,So you consider that one of Hihaku's then?[l][p]
d1_040_0214,Whatever, we'll worry about that later. That's[r]three. What about the others?[l][p]
d1_040_0215,W-well, the others are...[l][p]
d1_040_0216,Ah, the Foot-Washing Mansion and...[r]the Evergreen Beech.[l][p]
d1_040_0217,What!?[l][p]
d1_040_0218,And lastly... The Fool's Procession, if I recall.[l][p]
d1_040_0219,...So you claim.[r]How about it, mademoiselle?[l][p]
d1_040_0220,That's wrong! Those three are with Inspector[r]Tsutsumi![l][p]
d1_040_0221,I gave the Fool's Procession to him myself,[r]so I know he's wrong![l][p]
d1_040_0222,There you have it. Too bad for you, pal.[l][p]
d1_040_0223,Ngh...[l][p]
d1_040_0224,If our agreement was founded on lies, then I have[r]no duty to hand over my curse stone like I'd[r]promised.[l][p]
d1_040_0225,Ngh...[l][p]
d1_040_0226,Meaning the only curse stone you have is the[r]Whispering Canal.[l][p]
d1_040_0227,And it inevitably follows that you used it[r]to kill that young man at Kinshibori Park.[l][p]
d1_040_0228,Such a horrible act, and to your own employee,[r]no less.[l][p]
d1_040_0229,...[l][p]
d1_040_0230,...No, there you are mistaken.[l][p]
d1_040_0231,To be entirely frank with you...[r]We do not possess a single curse stone.[l][p]
d1_040_0232,...What?[l][p]
d1_040_0233,We, planned to collect soul dregs using any method[r]available to us, of course, as we needed the Rite.[l][p]
d1_040_0234,But committing murder ourselves was too much of[r]a risk.[l][p]
d1_040_0235,We intended on having others collect the soul[r]dregs for us.[l][p]
d1_040_0236,Is that so...[l][p]
d1_040_0237,Therefore, I myself have no soul dregs in my[r]possession.[l][p]
d1_040_0238,It was our plan to arrange for...particularly[r]greedy individuals to receive the curses.[l][p]
d1_040_0239,What...?[l][p]
d1_040_0240,It is possible Shogo Okiie came to possess the[r]Whispering Canal because of that.[l][p]
d1_040_0241,But by the time I became aware of this, he was[r]already dead.[l][p]
d1_040_0242,I don't believe you. Are you really trying to[r]talk your way out of this now?[l][p]
d1_040_0243,Or do you really want me to believe a Hihaku[r]employee was cursed by complete coincidence?[l][p]
d1_040_0244,That is the truth, whether you believe me or not.[l][p]
d1_040_0245,It must have been someone else entirely[r]who took Shogo Okiie's stone and killed him.[l][p]
d1_040_0246,I have no idea whatsoever whose hands the[r]Whispering Canal is in now, nor where it may be.[l][p]
d1_040_0247,Oh, could it really be...?[l][p]
d1_040_0248,Then it wasn't Hihaku who put the idea in[r]Fumichika Nejima's head to get a curse stone[r]either...?[l][p]
d1_040_0249,Nejima...? The only ones we've negotiated with[r]are Iwai and Araishi.[l][p]
d1_040_0250,Interesting...[l][p]
d1_040_0251,Excuse me, but does that mean you don't know the[r]location of the remaining curse stones either?[l][p]
d1_040_0252,There's one that hasn't been mentioned...[r]What about the Taiko of Tsugaru?[l][p]
d1_040_0253,Oooh, good question, my mysterious mademoiselle.[l][p]
d1_040_0254,I'm afraid we have no information in that regard[r]either.[l][p]
d1_040_0255,...Have you heard enough about curse stones?[r]I have nothing else to tell you.[l][p]
d1_040_0256,Hmm...[l][p]
d1_040_0257,Excuse me, Mr. Investigator?[l][p]
d1_040_0258,What is it, mademoiselle?[l][p]
d1_040_0259,Would you...be willing to give up the curse stone[r]you have?[l][p]
d1_040_0260,Ah yes, you have a point. They're too dangerous[r]to carelessly walk around with in one's pocket.[l][p]
d1_040_0261,However—sorry to disappoint you—that's[r]not possible at the moment.[l][p]
d1_040_0262,A-and why is that...?[l][p]
d1_040_0263,Ah, you don't know, do you? Then I'll tell both[r]you and our friend from Hihaku over there.[l][p]
d1_040_0264,Hm...?[l][p]
d1_040_0265,I doubt any of you have attempted it yet...[l][p]
d1_040_0266,But it seems that curse stones cannot be given[r]to normal people.
d1_040_0267,Huh?[l][p]
d1_040_0268,What...?[l][p]
d1_040_0269,I actually tested it with the madame here[r]earlier.[l][p]
d1_040_0270,Even if you give the curse stone to someone else,[r]the curse bearer doesn't change, and the stone[r]eventually makes its way back to the bearer.[l][p]
d1_040_0271,It's almost obvious when you think about it,[r]seeing as how the curse stones appeared to the[r]curse bearers of their own accord to begin with.[l][p]
d1_040_0272,But... Inspector Tsutsumi has collected curse[r]stones from other curse bearers...[l][p]
d1_040_0273,Then Inspector Tsutsumi must be a curse bearer[r]himself.[l][p]
d1_040_0274,Ah...[l][p]
d1_040_0275,So from what you're saying, curse stones can[r]only be transferred between curse bearers...[l][p]
d1_040_0276,And obtaining a curse stone alone doesn't make[r]someone a curse bearer, so they can't use its curse?[l][p]
d1_040_0277,Exactly. So they aren't quite as dangerous[r]as you think.[l][p]
d1_040_0278,As for Hihaku's intention of just collecting the[r]curse stones for themselves...[l][p]
d1_040_0279,Unfortunately for them, it was never going to[r]work, unless there's a curse bearer among them.[l][p]
d1_040_0280,Hrk...[l][p]
d1_040_0281,That damn Araishi... How could he not know this...[l][p]
d1_040_0282,That must be why I sensed that I couldn't take[r]Yakko's curse stone...[l][p]
d1_040_0283,I returned it right away when I borrowed it[r]from her earlier.[l][p]
d1_040_0284,That's precisely how it works, my mysterious[r]mademoiselle. I'll give mine directly to Inspector[r]Tsutsumi later.[l][p]
d1_040_0285,If you know Inspector Tsutsumi, then I think[r]that's best. Thank you.[l][p]
d1_040_0286,...Excuse me. Are you new to all of this too?[l][p]
d1_040_0287,Oh, um... I guess I'm kind of just tagging along.[l][p]
d1_040_0288,Hehe, me too.[l][p]
d1_040_0289,Let's make sure to not get in the way, shall we?[l][p]
d1_040_0290,Uh... Right.[l][p]
d1_040_0291,Excuse me. I had no idea that Gamyodo was[r]connected with Hihaku.[l][p]
d1_040_0292,So I'd just like to ask...[l][p]
d1_040_0293,Was it Ms. Yamamori from Hihaku who obtained[r]the Record of Fates and passed it on to Araishi?[l][p]
d1_040_0294,...[l][p]
d1_040_0295,No, that was not the case.[l][p]
d1_040_0296,Oh. My mistake![l][p]
d1_040_0297,Was it Suiden Gamyodo's doing, then?[l][p]
d1_040_0298,No, it was not.[l][p]
d1_040_0299,We first learned of the Record of Fates from[r]Mr. Araishi.[l][p]
d1_040_0300,It was then that Ms. Yamamori gained an interest,[r]and extended a contract to compensate him in[r]return for his research and findings.[l][p]
d1_040_0301,Then who was it that activated the Feast of[r]Shadows to call forth the curse of the Seven[r]Mysteries?[l][p]
d1_040_0302,I give you my word that we had no part in that.[l][p]
d1_040_0303,We had learned from Araishi beforehand that[r]something would happen at midnight last night,[r]that is all.[l][p]
d1_040_0304,Hey! There's no way that's true! Stop lying![l][p]
d1_040_0305,Ah! I must ask that you please refrain from[r]violence.[l][p]
d1_040_0306,Hold on, Yakko. It's all right.[l][p]
d1_040_0307,The minute I learned that Gamyodo was none[r]other than the queen of Hihaku herself, I felt[r]that was the case.[l][p]
d1_040_0308,She doesn't have strong enough spirit sense[r]for it.[l][p]
d1_040_0309,Oh. Gotcha.[l][p]
d1_040_0310,Urgh... While it is somewhat shameful, if you[r]require proof, then so be it.[l][p]
d1_040_0311,What, so that talk of supernatural powers was[r]just hot air?[l][p]
d1_040_0312,I don't think she has zero spirit sense...[r]but even Yakko here has more than her...[l][p]
d1_040_0313,I do?[l][p]
d1_040_0314,Also, the spirit power lingering in this park[r]has been bothering me for quite some time.[l][p]
d1_040_0315,The person who died here must have had[r]considerably powerful spirit sense...[l][p]
d1_040_0316,If they were a Hihaku employee, then maybe they[r]should have been the one running things...[l][p]
d1_040_0317,My... To think Shogo Okiie was so talented...[l][p]
d1_040_0318,At any rate, Hihaku wasn't the mastermind behind[r]exposing the Record of Fates to the world and[r]initiating the Feast of Shadows.[l][p]
d1_040_0319,I think we can be sure about that.[l][p]
d1_040_0320,Hmm... All right.[l][p]
d1_040_0321,And you know about the Record of Fates Yin Scroll[r]too, don't you?[l][p]
d1_040_0322,If you were researching the Rite of Resurrection[r]in the Record of Fates, then you must've looked[r]into the Yin Scroll as well.[l][p]
d1_040_0323,...That's right. The Record of Fates alone wasn't[r]enough to learn how to collect soul dregs.[l][p]
d1_040_0324,I'm sure you looked into many things on your own,[r]but how much do you actually know?[l][p]
d1_040_0325,Who and where Seiman Tsuchimikado's descendants[r]are... Were you able to find that sort of[r]information with Gamyodo's connections?[l][p]
d1_040_0326,Hmph. I can't reveal that...[l][p]
d1_040_0327,Then would you prefer I expose to the public how[r]Gamyodo is a fraud with almost zero spirit sense?[l][p]
d1_040_0328,Urk...[l][p]
d1_040_0329,Fine. I understand.[l][p]
d1_040_0330,From the results of our independent research...[l][p]
d1_040_0331,I found that Seiman Tsuchimikado's descendant...[c3]was Hajime Yoshimi.[c0]
d1_040_0332,What...!?[l][p]
d1_040_0333,So that's why you went after Hajime![l][p]
d1_040_0334,However, Hajime Yoshimi was only carrying a[r]fragment of the whole.[l][p]
d1_040_0335,A fragment...?[l][p]
d1_040_0336,That's right... He did say something about a[r]fragment of an old manuscript![l][p]
d1_040_0337,The location of the Yin scroll was hidden.[l][p]
d1_040_0338,This information was split into two and hidden in[r][c3]a pair of talismans[c0], which were then passed down[r]from generation to generation.[l][p]
d1_040_0339,Ah! Talismans!?[l][p]
d1_040_0340,I see...[l][p]
d1_040_0341,Hajime Yoshimi was supposed to have one.[l][p]
d1_040_0342,But it was almost certainly stolen when he was[r]killed.[l][p]
d1_040_0343,It's possible that he knew the location of the[r]other as well.[l][p]
d1_040_0344,So that's why you questioned me about the things[r]he'd inherited...[l][p]
d1_040_0345,The girl Hajime had been helping recently must[r]have had it then...[l][p]
d1_040_0346,Oh! Michiyo's talisman![l][p]
d1_040_0347,Yes... Michiyo Shiraishi was also likely a[r]descendant of Seiman Tsuchimikado.[l][p]
d1_040_0348,Wh-what!?[l][p]
d1_040_0349,The talisman she carried as a keepsake from her[r]father... We searched for it based on Ms. Chozawa's[r]memories.[l][p]
d1_040_0350,However...[l][p]
d1_040_0351,Michiyo Shiraishi was already dead.[l][p]
d1_040_0352,Yes. By coincidence, she happened to be closely[r]connected to Mr. Iwai, so we began our investigation there.[l][p]
d1_040_0353,But he was already dead, too, leaving you in[r]a quandary.[l][p]
d1_040_0354,...[l][p]
d1_040_0355,I see...[l][p]
d1_040_0356,Mio, if we can get both of the talismans...![l][p]
d1_040_0357,Yep, we'll know the location of the Record of[r]Fates Yin Scroll![l][p]
d1_040_0358,Wow...[r]Sometimes the answer is right under your nose.[l][p]
d1_040_0359,Sometimes those answers are the hardest to find...[l][p]
d1_040_0360,Yakko. Let's keep quiet about the location of[r]the talismans for now, okay?[l][p]
d1_040_0361,Ah... Right. No need for Yumioka to know.[l][p]
d1_040_0362,That was a close one.[r]I almost let it slip...[l][p]
d1_040_0363,<i>Wow, seeing a bunch of adults surround another[r]adult like this is pretty wild...[l][p]
d1_040_0364,Okay... I think that's about all we have to ask him.[l][p]
d1_040_0365,We'll let you off for today since you went along[r]with all our questions nicely.[l][p]
d1_040_0366,A pleasure working with you. We're done here.[l][p]
d1_040_0367,But the information you have...[l][p]
d1_040_0368,The hell are you whining about!?[r]I said we're done, so scram![l][p]
d1_040_0369,Ngh...![l][p]
d1_040_0370,That's all our business as well, so I shall be[r]bidding you all farewell.[l][p]
d1_040_0371,...Yes, right.[l][p]
d1_040_0372,Excuse me, Mr. Investigator... Please don't forget[r]about that curse stone...[l][p]
d1_040_0373,Don't you fret, I'll hand it over to Inspector[r]Tsutsumi like I promised. I'm glad I didn't end up[r]having to give it to that Yumioka![l][p]
d1_040_0374,Let's take our leave, Madame! With this, we'll[r]be freed from this troublesome curse ourselves![l][p]
d1_040_0375,...[l][p]
d1_040_0376,That lady and the investigator...[r]We should keep an eye on them.[l][p]
d1_040_0377,Agreed.[l][p]
d1_040_0378,Really? Why?[l][p]
d1_040_0379,I think they're up to something.[r]Just my intuition, but still.[l][p]
d1_040_0380,Yeah. I wonder what that investigator really[r]wanted out of all of this...[l][p]
d1_040_0381,If his goal was getting information about the[r]curse stones...then this might be bad.[l][p]
d1_040_0382,Oh, right. I got one of those curse stones too.[r]The Beckoning Light.[l][p]
d1_040_0383,Oh, right, if you wouldn't mind, would you give[r]it to Inspector Tsutsumi without using it?[l][p]
d1_040_0384,Yeah, sure. If you introduce me to the cop,[r]that is.[l][p]
d1_040_0385,I feel like if I keep carrying it around with me[r]I'll start getting some weird ideas too.[l][p]
d1_040_0386,...[l][p]
d1_040_0387,I just remembered! Mayu, I have something[r]important to tell you![l][p]
d1_040_0388,Whoa! What's with all the yelling all of a sudden?[l][p]
d1_040_0389,You know a girl named Hitomi Okuda, don't you?[l][p]
d1_040_0390,...Really!? Hitomi has Hajime's talisman!?[l][p]
d1_040_0391,Yes. He entrusted it to her in a panic just[r]before his death.[l][p]
d1_040_0392,He sensed an imminent crisis closing in on him,[r]but Hitomi was the only one around that he could[r]ask for help.[l][p]
d1_040_0393,That so... I'm sorry she got left with such[r]a big responsibility.[l][p]
d1_040_0394,That must mean that Hajime got killed by someone[r]who was after that talisman.[l][p]
d1_040_0395,But since he gave it to someone else, they[r]couldn't steal it like they wanted.[l][p]
d1_040_0396,I'll have to thank Hitomi for that.[l][p]
d1_040_0397,Umm... I also think it's going to be hard for[r]us to get her to give up the talisman.[l][p]
d1_040_0398,Yeah, you may be right. It was Hajime's dying[r]request to her...[l][p]
d1_040_0399,So you two need the talisman for something?[l][p]
d1_040_0400,Yeah![l][p]
d1_040_0401,Hm... Personally, I'd like to use the talisman[r]as bait.[l][p]
d1_040_0402,Then I could get my hands on the bastard that[r]killed Hajime.[l][p]
d1_040_0403,Please. I promise we'll uncover the mastermind[r]behind all this.[l][p]
d1_040_0404,They probably have supernatural abilities at[r]their disposal. Please leave them to us.[l][p]
d1_040_0405,Yeah! We'll catch them, don't you worry![l][p]
d1_040_0406,Well look at that...[r]You've got that look in your eyes.[l][p]
d1_040_0407,The look that young people get that says[r]they'll get something done no matter what it[r]takes. How am I supposed to say no to that?[l][p]
d1_040_0408,You go find them and give them what they deserve[r]for what they did for my Hajime, you hear?[l][p]
d1_040_0409,We will. I'm pretty mad at them myself.[l][p]
d1_040_0410,If punches work on 'em, I'll give 'em a good one![l][p]
d1_040_0411,Ahaha! Now that I can get behind! I'll leave it[r]to you two![l][p]
d1_040_0412,Now then, your next move should be to find[r]Hitomi and get that talisman.[l][p]
d1_040_0413,Though isn't there one more talisman that you need?[l][p]
d1_040_0414,Right. But we've got a pretty good idea of where[r]the one Michiyo had is.[l][p]
d1_040_0415,We'll have to check with Inspector Tsutsumi[r]about that. We should go back to the school and[r]call him.[l][p]
d1_040_0416,You got it. Okay, I'll head to the high school[r]now and wait for you there.[l][p]
d1_040_0417,Perfect![l][p]

d1_050_0008,Mr. Tsutsumi, this is Mayu Chozawa.[l][p]
d1_050_0009,Ah, so you're the one. The Sumida Police was[r]looking for you. Glad to see you're all right.[l][p]
d1_050_0010,Sorry. I should have told someone I was okay.[r]I was just so pissed off.[l][p]
d1_050_0011,Falling right into Hihaku's hands... I got myself[r]into some deep shit.[l][p]
d1_050_0012,Hihaku seem like they're still up to something.[r]We'll have to make sure they clean up their act,[r]once and for all.[l][p]
d1_050_0013,...Get it? 'Cause they sell soap?[l][p]
d1_050_0014,...[l][p]
d1_050_0015,...Nice one, Boss![r]You're really on top of your game today![l][p]
d1_050_0016,Stop trying to make me feel better![r]I shouldn't have said anything![l][p]
d1_050_0017,More importantly, Mayu, thank you for your[r]cooperation with Yoshimi![l][p]
d1_050_0018,We'll get to the bottom of it, I promise![l][p]
d1_050_0019,Oh, you must be Detective Erio. I heard a lot[r]about you from Hajime.[l][p]
d1_050_0020,I'll be counting on you.[r]Catch whoever did this. No matter what.[l][p]
d1_050_0021,!
d1_050_0022,Talk
d1_050_0023,Mio Kurosuzu
d1_050_0024,Mayu Chozawa
d1_050_0025,Tetsuo Tsutsumi
d1_050_0026,Jun Erio
d1_050_0027,Think
d1_050_0028,They've all but finished investigating the[r]crime scene, and the police have mostly left.[l][p]
d1_050_0029,But they're letting us use the school as our[r]base of communications as per Inspector Tsutsumi's[r]request.[l][p]
d1_050_0030,I'm not sure why, but I feel fired up.[l][p]
d1_050_0031,It feels like we're close to the moment of truth.[r]I think Mio feels the same.[l][p]
d1_050_0032,Mayu rushed to Hitomi's place and back[r]for us.[l][p]
d1_050_0033,She's been trying to appear calm, but I'm sure[r]she must still be in shock.[l][p]
d1_050_0034,I bet he's making jokes and stuff at a time like[r]this because he doesn't want to stress us out.[l][p]
d1_050_0035,I wonder if he's able to stay so calm 'cause of[r]experience, or if he's just that kind of person.[l][p]
d1_050_0036,Detective Erio was nice enough to get us something[r]to drink earlier.[l][p]
d1_050_0037,Seeing a detective take time for little things[r]like that helps put my mind at ease a little.[l][p]
d1_050_0038,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori02 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #02[c0] discovered!
d1_050_0039,Oh, Mr. Tsutsumi.[l][p]
d1_050_0040,I received a message from Paranormal Affairs[r]earlier.[l][p]
d1_050_0041,It wasn't from Nakagoshi, but I had someone look[r]into something for me.[l][p]
d1_050_0042,So even the desk jockeys are lending a hand.[r]Brings a tear to your eye.[l][p]
d1_050_0043,So, what'd they say?[l][p]
d1_050_0044,Right. About the onmyoji woman who was in Edo[r]at the time of the Honjo Incident...[l][p]
d1_050_0045,She was a person of great beauty and discerning[r]taste, but also shamelessly did whatever she[r]wanted.[l][p]
d1_050_0046,It seemed to match the person seen in the[r]resentful memory for the Foot-Washing Mansion.[l][p]
d1_050_0047,Huh. So she must be the one who fought with[r]Seiman over the Rite.[l][p]
d1_050_0048,And they found that her name was [c3]Ashino[c0].[l][p]
d1_050_0049,Ashino, huh... What else?[l][p]
d1_050_0050,Umm... That's all.[l][p]
d1_050_0051,That's not much help...[l][p]
d1_050_0052,Oh, but...[l][p]
d1_050_0053,Apparently she was quite the powerful onmyoji...[l][p]
d1_050_0054,And she died bearing a similarly powerful[r]resentment.[l][p]
d1_050_0055,It's possible that she became a vengeful spirit[r]with a connection to the Seven Mysteries.[l][p]
d1_050_0056,A vengeful spirit...?[l][p]
d1_050_0057,If any descendants of Ashino or people otherwise[r]closely aligned with her live today...[l][p]
d1_050_0058,There's a possibility that spirit awakened and[r]possessed them.[l][p]
d1_050_0059,Yeah, you mentioned before that spirits can[r]possess people who are closely in sync with[r]them...[l][p]
d1_050_0060,Though this of course doesn't mean the spirit[r]houses her complete personality.[l][p]
d1_050_0061,Her resentment, and her spirit power, those are[r]the parts of her that would have the strongest[r]influence.[l][p]
d1_050_0062,Since Seiman's descendants are still around in[r]the present, it wouldn't be surprising if Ashino's[r]were too.[l][p]
d1_050_0063,They might just be desk jockeys, but they[r]wouldn't give us this info if it was only[r]speculation...[l][p]
d1_050_0064,They must have found some amount of evidence,[r]looking into abnormal phenomena or things like[r]that.[l][p]
d1_050_0065,Oh... The Feast of Shadows...[l][p]
d1_050_0066,There it is, our abnormal phenomenon.[l][p]
d1_050_0067,Mio, what do you mean...?[l][p]
d1_050_0068,The person who initiated the curse this time,[r]who we've been calling the mastermind...[l][p]
d1_050_0069,They might be possessed by the vengeful spirit of[r]the onmyoji named Ashino, the enemy of Seiman.[l][p]
d1_050_0070,Do we have any idea who they could be or where[r]to find them?[l][p]
d1_050_0071,Like, if you looked at them, Mio, would you be[r]able to tell right away?[l][p]
d1_050_0072,Err...[l][p]
d1_050_0073,It's like how I didn't realize that Michiyo had[r]fused with your consciousness, Yakko.[l][p]
d1_050_0074,Common spirits will leak spirit energy left and[r]right, so I can notice them just by looking[r]carefully...[l][p]
d1_050_0075,But when spirits of a higher caliber fuse with[r]someone's consciousness, detecting them isn't[r]so simple.[l][p]
d1_050_0076,Oh...[l][p]
d1_050_0077,I'm sorry... My skills still need a lot of work...[r]And I don't have anything else to offer...[l][p]
d1_050_0078,Mio, that's not true at all! You're fine![r]We'll make this work somehow or other.[l][p]
d1_050_0079,Thanks...[l][p]
d1_050_0080,Basically, I believe the mastermind behind[r]everything is a woman possessed by the vengeful[r]spirit of the onmyoji Ashino.[l][p]
d1_050_0081,I see...[l][p]
d1_050_0082,Is this mastermind also the one who killed Hajime[r]trying to get the Record of Fates Yin Scroll?[l][p]
d1_050_0083,Yes... I think that's very likely.[l][p]
d1_050_0084,So that's how it is, huh.[l][p]
d1_050_0085,Then I want you to catch them no matter what![l][p]
d1_050_0086,Oh, Mayu! Did you meet with Hitomi?[l][p]
d1_050_0087,Yeah. I met her at the spot I was told.[l][p]
d1_050_0088,She was acting tough...but I think the incident[r]with Hajime has her really shaken up.[l][p]
d1_050_0089,...I briefly explained our situation and had[r]her give Hajime's talisman to me.[l][p]
d1_050_0090,Here. This is what you're looking for, right?[l][p]
d1_050_0091,[N:src=Images/itm_omamori2 w=300 h=300 x=0 y=40 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Yang Talisman[c0] acquired.
d1_050_0092,Yes, I believe that's it. Thank you so much.[l][p]
d1_050_0093,Um, Mr. Tsutsumi, about this...[l][p]
d1_050_0094,Right. You should hold onto it, Mio. Not like we[r]could use it as it is.[l][p]
d1_050_0095,Try to figure out what we'll need to do once we[r]get both halves together.[l][p]
d1_050_0096,Understood. I'll see what I can do.[l][p]
d1_050_0097,Do you know where the other talisman is?[l][p]
d1_050_0098,Um... Yes.[r]...Probably.[l][p]
d1_050_0099,This is Hajime's last job.[r]Finish it for him, okay?[l][p]
d1_050_0100,We will.[l][p]
d1_050_0101,I guess this is the end of his family line[r]too, huh...[l][p]
d1_050_0102,All the people who inherited that talisman before[r]him are already all gone...[l][p]
d1_050_0103,...Ah, I heard you had a curse stone too?[l][p]
d1_050_0104,Yeah. I should give it to you then, right?[l][p]
d1_050_0105,Those things really are a pain in the ass. I'll[r]gladly hand it over to you before it starts[r]giving me any crazy ideas.[l][p]
d1_050_0106,So this is the Beckoning Light, huh?[l][p]
d1_050_0107,All right, it's safe and sound with me.[l][p]
d1_050_0108,Sorry you won't be able to bring him back.[l][p]
d1_050_0109,Don't worry about it. He and I were always[r]prepared for the worst anyway.[l][p]
d1_050_0110,What the...?[l][p]
d1_050_0111,What's wrong?[l][p]
d1_050_0112,Damn...[l][p]
d1_050_0113,The trigger for the Beckoning Light's curse[r]is...some serious shit.[l][p]
d1_050_0114,Yeah... I thought so too. That's why I said it'd[r]give me weird ideas. See what I mean now?[l][p]
d1_050_0115,How's it work?[l][p]
d1_050_0116,I'll leave you a note you can read later.[r]We have more important things to worry about now.[l][p]
d1_050_0117,Right...[l][p]
d1_050_0118,Mr. Tsutsumi.[l][p]
d1_050_0119,Does that make it five curse stones that you've[r]gathered now?[l][p]
d1_050_0120,Should be. I wanna get the other four under wraps[r]soon as we can.[l][p]
d1_050_0121,Let's see... I have no idea about the Whispering[r]Canal...[l][p]
d1_050_0122,Someone made off with the One-Sided Reed which[r]Nejima had...[l][p]
d1_050_0123,Yeah. Damn shame.[l][p]
d1_050_0124,After that... We don't know about the Taiko of[r]Tsugaru either, do we?[l][p]
d1_050_0125,After that... You said earlier that the Taiko of[r]Tsugaru might be with your daughter, Inspector?[l][p]
d1_050_0126,...[r]Well... Let's set that one aside for now.[l][p]
d1_050_0127,So... We can assume that curse bearers are still[r]prowling around out there with those ones.[l][p]
d1_050_0128,What a headache...[r]Hopefully we can find them soon...[l][p]
d1_050_0129,Come to think of it, did Old Man Ashimiya end up[r]getting away?[l][p]
d1_050_0130,Ugh...[r]So words already out, huh?[l][p]
d1_050_0131,He was cornered, but managed to take a hostage[r]and escape...is what I heard on the radio.[l][p]
d1_050_0132,What happened after that?[l][p]
d1_050_0133,So that's all they're reporting...[r]Here's what really happened...[l][p]
d1_050_0134,He was...killed!?[l][p]
d1_050_0135,And the hostage was Tsutsumi's daughter whose[r]whereabouts are still unknown!?[l][p]
d1_050_0136,Yep. His daughter showing up was a huge[r]surprise... Even Boss couldn't believe it.[l][p]
d1_050_0137,Damn it! The hell do you expect? No one could've[r]seen that coming![l][p]
d1_050_0138,So there's already an emergency search underway[r]for her as a key witness and suspect.[l][p]
d1_050_0139,I'll be rejoining the search for her after we're[r]done here.[l][p]
d1_050_0140,Key witness and suspect...[l][p]
d1_050_0141,But wasn't she a hostage?[l][p]
d1_050_0142,Could she have killed Nejima and fled the scene?[l][p]
d1_050_0143,Well, it's just a possibility.[l][p]
d1_050_0144,Ngh...[l][p]
d1_050_0145,If we're talking possibilities, might as well[r]tell them everything.[l][p]
d1_050_0146,It's very likely that Nejima was killed by a[r]curse stone...
d1_050_0147,What...? By a curse bearer!?[l][p]
d1_050_0148,Oh! It's already evening, so the effect of the[r]Feast of Shadows would be starting to return...![l][p]
d1_050_0149,Yeah. Which makes it likely that a curse was[r]used to kill him.[l][p]
d1_050_0150,Boss, you're repeating yourself![r]Try to calm down for a sec![l][p]
d1_050_0151,But that would mean...[l][p]
d1_050_0152,The Inspector's daughter is probably a curse[r]bearer, right?[l][p]
d1_050_0153,Huh? Did you say something? Maybe I'm losing my[r]hearing in my old age...[l][p]
d1_050_0154,Boss, you can hear just fine! Don't play the[r]old man card every time you want to get out of[r]something![l][p]
d1_050_0155,We even talked about how she might have the[r]Taiko of Tsugaru if that's the case.[l][p]
d1_050_0156,Did we? My memory's a little hazy...[l][p]
d1_050_0157,You've got a soft spot for your daughter,[r]don't you, Inspector?[l][p]
d1_050_0158,Grr...[l][p]
d1_050_0159,It just...hits a little too close to home now.[l][p]
d1_050_0160,But either way, we have to find her as soon as[r]possible![l][p]
d1_050_0161,That's why we'll be joining the search as soon[r]as we're done here![l][p]
d1_050_0162,One more thing. There's a very good chance that[r]his daughter has Michiyo Shiraishi's talisman.[l][p]
d1_050_0163,All the more reason for you to get back to that[r]search. Best of luck.[l][p]
d1_050_0164,What the hell has she gotten herself into...[l][p]
d1_050_0165,<i>It feels like we're finally coming up on the[r]moment of truth.[l][p]
d1_050_0166,<i>I don't know what will happen when we put the[r]talismans together and obtain the Record of Fates[r]Yin Scroll...[l][p]
d1_050_0167,Now, is that everything we needed to chat about?[l][p]
d1_050_0168,If you don't need anything else, we'll be[r]going back to the search.[l][p]
d1_050_0169,Um... There actually is one thing...[l][p]
d1_050_0170,Oh? What's that?[l][p]
d1_050_0171,Um, just completely hypothetically...[l][p]
d1_050_0172,Hypothetically, what if the Inspector's[r]daughter...was the mastermind?[l][p]
d1_050_0173,I mean, she's a woman...[l][p]
d1_050_0174,It seems like she was after the talismans...[l][p]
d1_050_0175,Hmm... Sorry, don't really understand what you[r]mean.[l][p]
d1_050_0176,Boss, come on! We've gotta look at the facts![l][p]
d1_050_0177,But that would mean Inspector Tsutsumi would also[r]have to be one of Ashino's descendants.[l][p]
d1_050_0178,Oh, right...[r]You're just a normal person, right, Inspector?[l][p]
d1_050_0179,Unless that's why you're so resistant to the[r]paranormal.[l][p]
d1_050_0180,...[l][p]
d1_050_0181,Don't believe I've ever heard anything about[r]being related to some onmyoji.[l][p]
d1_050_0182,Oh...[l][p]
d1_050_0183,But...[l][p]
d1_050_0184,Well... If you put it like that...[l][p]
d1_050_0185,Her being the mastermind...[r]It's possible.
d1_050_0186,Really...?[l][p]
d1_050_0187,Uh, I say possible, but I mean unlikely.[r]Is...what I want to think...[l][p]
d1_050_0188,Damn it, I don't even want to imagine it...[l][p]
d1_050_0189,Boss. If we're going to consider it, we have to[r]do it properly. No dragging your heels about it.[l][p]
d1_050_0190,No, it's not that.[l][p]
d1_050_0191,There's something I never told her.[r]Never wanted to tell her.[l][p]
d1_050_0192,The truth is, she's not my real daughter.[l][p]
d1_050_0193,What...![l][p]
d1_050_0194,Twenty years ago... Well, it's a long story, but[r]we took her in when she was just a baby.[l][p]
d1_050_0195,Do you know anything about her birth parents?[l][p]
d1_050_0196,You could...say I do, I guess, but really,[r]I don't know anything.[l][p]
d1_050_0197,What's that supposed to mean? I don't get it.[l][p]
d1_050_0198,...Erio.[l][p]
d1_050_0199,You heard what I said, didn't you?[l][p]
d1_050_0200,Just now?[l][p]
d1_050_0201,About twenty years ago?[l][p]
d1_050_0202,No... Boss, that can't be![l][p]
d1_050_0203,Nejima's...?[l][p]
d1_050_0204,That's right.[l][p]
d1_050_0205,When we arrested Fumichika Nejima, there was a[r]baby at his house on the brink of death.[l][p]
d1_050_0206,That was...my daughter, Ayame Tsutsumi.[r]She goes by Ayame Tono now.
d1_050_0207,Wh-what!?[l][p]
d1_050_0208,Someone had to take care of her. A baby holds no[r]blame for the circumstances she came from.[l][p]
d1_050_0209,B-but...Boss...[l][p]
d1_050_0210,According to Nejima...[l][p]
d1_050_0211,That baby...[l][p]
d1_050_0212,...[l][p]
d1_050_0213,It's his former lover reincarnated using black[r]magic![l][p]
d1_050_0214,What...?[l][p]
d1_050_0215,Personally, I think that story is bullshit.[l][p]
d1_050_0216,According to Nejima...[l][p]
d1_050_0217,My goodness...[l][p]
d1_050_0218,It's hard to believe from Nejima's behavior,[r]but... Could it really be true?[l][p]
d1_050_0219,I've got a few doubts.[l][p]
d1_050_0220,We have to question whether the "Shino" woman[r]ever really existed in the first place.[l][p]
d1_050_0221,There are no records of her, and no body was[r]found... Her name never came up once during the[r]investigation.[l][p]
d1_050_0222,Even if this woman really existed, I'm skeptical[r]that someone could be reincarnated as a baby[r]through black magic.[l][p]
d1_050_0223,...I agree. No matter how you look at it, a spell[r]with that effect is hard to believe.[l][p]
d1_050_0224,...Even the supernatural has rules that must be[r]followed.[l][p]
d1_050_0225,Seems more likely he's deluded himself, not[r]wanting to recognize that a spell he risked his[r]life on failed to work.[l][p]
d1_050_0226,That's my thinking too.[l][p]
d1_050_0227,The more natural conclusion is that the baby[r]is his and Shino's, and that she died in[r]childbirth.[l][p]
d1_050_0228,As long as we don't know Shino's origins, we[r]have to consider the possibility that she could[r]be a descendant of Ashino.[l][p]
d1_050_0229,Huh. If nothing else, their names are pretty[r]similar...[l][p]
d1_050_0230,Okay, assuming all of that is true for a moment...[l][p]
d1_050_0231,Ayame getting taken away by Nejima and then[r]killing him...[l][p]
d1_050_0232,That would mean that she killed her own father![l][p]
d1_050_0233,Calm down. This is all still conjecture.[l][p]
d1_050_0234,But now that Nejima is dead, we have no means[r]to investigate.[l][p]
d1_050_0235,So regardless of everything, there's only one[r]thing that matters.[l][p]
d1_050_0236,...She's my daughter.[l][p]
d1_050_0237,As her parent, I'm responsible for her. Nothing[r]can change that.[l][p]
d1_050_0238,...I understand.[l][p]
d1_050_0239,All right, we should get back to the search.[l][p]
d1_050_0240,We'll find her and clear up all of this.[l][p]
d1_050_0241,Yes, sir![l][p]
d1_050_0242,The talisman you young ladies are looking for[r]has something to do with this as well. I'd[r]appreciate it if you could help us find it.[l][p]
d1_050_0243,So if anything happens, please call the police.[l][p]
d1_050_0244,We will.[l][p]
d1_050_0245,I'm worried about Hitomi, so I'm going to head[r]to where she is.[l][p]
d1_050_0246,I'll be waiting to hear some good news from[r]you all.[l][p]

e1_010_0143,<i>Someone's talking... On the phone...?[l][p]
e1_010_0144,...Yes. ...Yes. Quite stubborn. We had to use[r]the maximum dose of truth serum.[l][p]

e1_010_0154,Such a harsh accusation...[l][p]
e1_010_0155,It was you who was being uncooperative.[l][p]

e1_010_0157,I assure you, you have nothing to worry about.[r]You are in no danger.[l][p]
e1_010_0158,That being said... There may be some side effects.[r]Memory loss, brain fog...[l][p]

e1_010_0182,[a0.5]"Yes. She will certainly...want to bring back[r]her dead fiancé..."[l][p]
e1_010_0183,<i>...! Is he talking...about me?[l][p]

e1_010_0188,[a0.5]"Ah, yes. That is...in the [c3]cabinet[c0].[r]It should pose no problem."[l][p]
e1_010_0189,[a0.5]"Yes, I have changed the lock.[r]...the [c3]year of the company's founding[c0]."[l][p]
e1_010_0190,<i>Aah, I can't...hold on...any longer...[l][p]
e1_010_0191,That's right. I remember now.[l][p]
e1_010_0192,<i>That man...is Takumi Yumioka of Hihaku Soaps.[r]He showed up at my hair salon about a month ago...[l][p]
e1_010_0193,<i>He came to ask me to try out a new shampoo[r]they'd made.[l][p]
e1_010_0194,<i>We spoke about it again a few weeks later, but...[l][p]
e1_010_0195,He suddenly started asking me about my fiancé.[r]I remember thinking that was pretty weird.[l][p]
e1_010_0196,Hihaku is a huge company, so I tried to be polite[r]and answered all his questions.[l][p]
e1_010_0197,He wanted to know what kind of family Hajime[r]came from...[l][p]
e1_010_0198,If there was anything special about them,[r]or if he was heir to anything...[l][p]
e1_010_0199,I thought it was so strange, I didn't give him[r]any specifics.[l][p]
e1_010_0200,And then that night...[l][p]
e1_010_0201,He never came to the place we agreed to meet.[r]So I went to where he said he'd be going, the[r]Former Yasuda Gardens...[l][p]
e1_010_0202,That's where...I found his dead body...[l][p]
e1_010_0203,I was so distraught I just ran away...[r]I didn't want to believe what I was seeing.[l][p]
e1_010_0204,After that, I decided to put all my hopes in that[r]Rite of Resurrection everyone was talking about.[l][p]
e1_010_0205,I searched desperately for anything I could find[r]about the Seven Mysteries of Honjo.[l][p]
e1_010_0206,And then...[l][p]
e1_010_0207,Takumi showed up again.[l][p]
e1_010_0208,He told me that he knew something about how[r]Hajime died.[l][p]
e1_010_0209,I thought I would just act interested in what he[r]had to say, but... I fell for it completely.[l][p]
e1_010_0210,Next thing I knew, I was locked up in this room.[l][p]
e1_010_0211,Pumped full of drugs and left here on the floor,[r]barely even conscious.[l][p]
e1_010_0212,I spent the night dreaming of him, praying for a[r]chance at the Rite of Resurrection...[l][p]
e1_010_0213,And at midnight last night, I got the curse of[r]the Beckoning Light.[l][p]
e1_010_0214,Between the drugs and the curse, I passed out...[r]That must be why I lost my memory.[l][p]
e1_010_0215,But now I remember everything.[l][p]
e1_010_0216,It was Hihaku![r]They went after Hajime! They put me in here![l][p]
e1_010_0217,But why did they have to kill him...?[l][p]
e1_010_0218,Was that Hihaku's doing, too? What could they[r]have wanted with him...?[l][p]
e1_010_0219,I knew his job was dangerous, but why would a[r]company like that go after an officer in the[r]Juvenile Division?[l][p]
e1_010_0220,Ah... I get it now. All that about the shampoo[r]was just to get to Hajime...[l][p]
e1_010_0221,Haah...[l][p]
e1_010_0222,Hajime...[l][p]
e1_010_0223,You were always the kind of guy who could[r]shoulder any burden with a smile on your face.[l][p]
e1_010_0224,What burden were you carrying this time...?[l][p]
e1_010_0225,To be targeted by a company that's more than[r]willing to kidnap and drug people...[l][p]
e1_010_0226,Was it something you couldn't tell even me?[l][p]
e1_010_0227,...No.[l][p]
e1_010_0228,Takumi said he had gotten some kind of[r]information out of me using the drug...[l][p]
e1_010_0229,Could I have had Hajime's secret somewhere in[r]my memories?[l][p]
e1_010_0230,If I did...what could it have been?[l][p]
e1_010_0231,Did Hajime tell me something...?[l][p]
e1_010_0232,Ugh... Whatever it is, just let me say one thing...[l][p]
e1_010_0233,Fuck you, Hihaku! I'm not about to let any of[r]this go the way you want![l][p]
e1_010_0234,Yeah... That's right.[l][p]
e1_010_0235,It's up to me to protect any secret that Hajime[r]was trying to hide.[l][p]
e1_010_0236,I'll finish whatever it is he didn't get a chance to.[l][p]
e1_010_0237,After all...[l][p]
e1_010_0238,It's always been up to me to clean up your messes.[l][p]
e1_010_0239,It's okay. Whatever you got yourself involved in,[r]I'm sure you had good reason.[l][p]
e1_010_0240,We're gonna take them for all they got.[r]Just you wait and see.[l][p]
e1_010_0241,All right...[r]It's about time I got out of this dump.[l][p]
e1_010_0242,<i>On that note...[l][p]
e1_010_0243,<i>Takumi was using a telephone earlier.[l][p]
e1_010_0244,<i>He may have taken the phone with him, but now[r]I know that this place is on the network.[l][p]
e1_010_0245,<i>If I can find a way to contact someone on the[r]outside, I could call for help![l][p]
e1_010_0246,<i>Takumi was also talking about something he did[r]in here...[l][p]
e1_010_0247,<i>I think he mentioned a padlock combination...?[l][p]
e1_010_0248,<i>Did he say it was [c3]the year Hihaku was founded[c0]?[l][p]
e1_010_0249,<i>But unless there's some way I can find out what[r]year that was from in here...[l][p]
e1_010_0250,Okay, the first number from the left...
e1_010_0251,0
e1_010_0252,1
e1_010_0253,2
e1_010_0254,3
e1_010_0255,4
e1_010_0256,5
e1_010_0257,6
e1_010_0258,7
e1_010_0259,8
e1_010_0260,9
e1_010_0261,Now the second number...
e1_010_0262,The third...
e1_010_0263,And the last number...
e1_010_0264,Well...?[l][p]
e1_010_0265,No good.[l][p]
e1_010_0266,Guess I'm not gonna get anywhere by guessing.[r]I have to think about this a little more.[l][p]
e1_010_0267,Nope, that's not it either. I've already tried[r][$507] times...Probably time to get serious.[l][p]
e1_010_0268,Hmm... That didn't work either.[r]I don't think brute force is the answer here.[l][p]
e1_010_0269,Yes! It opened![l][p]
e1_010_0270,Huh...?[l][p]
e1_010_0271,But...how did the year Hihaku was established[r]suddenly appear in my mind?[l][p]
e1_010_0272,I had an idea when it might've been, but did I[r]really get that lucky?[l][p]
e1_010_0273,Now that I think about it...there's definitely[r]something different in the air here...[l][p]
e1_010_0274,Is this another side effect of the drug?[r]Or something else...?[l][p]
e1_010_0275,Well, it doesn't matter right now.[r]I should see what's in here.[l][p]
e1_010_0276,What is this thing...?[l][p]
e1_010_0277,Well, guess I might as well pull it out. Hngh...![l][p]
e1_010_0278,And...[l][p]
e1_010_0279,It looks sort of like a phone, but there's no[r]receiver...[l][p]
e1_010_0280,Oh, I know... This is a [c3]fax machine[c0].[r]I've seen commercials for these on TV.
e1_010_0281,If I remember correctly, it's used to send copies[r]of documents to other people who have one.[l][p]
e1_010_0282,What an age we live in where we can send letters[r]and things without going through the mailman![l][p]
e1_010_0283,This means...I can call for help without a telephone![l][p]
e1_010_0284,I've never used one before, but if I can connect[r]it to the power and the phone line...[l][p]
e1_010_0285,All right! We've got power. Now I just need to[r]figure out who I can send it to.[l][p]
e1_010_0286,What else do I need...?[l][p]
e1_010_0287,I found a bunch of paper in the cabinet.[l][p]
e1_010_0288,I'll need a [c4]pen[c0] to write with.[l][p]
e1_010_0289,And I'll need a phone number for a fax machine[r]to send this to.[l][p]
e1_010_0290,Hmm... What am I gonna do about that...?[l][p]
e1_010_0291,Fax Machine
e1_010_0292,I need a [c4]pen[c0] and a [c4]phone number[c0] for a fax machine.[l][p]
e1_010_0293,I have a pen and some paper... Now all I need is[r]a phone number I can send a fax to.[l][p]
e1_010_0294,Do I know of anywhere that has a fax machine...?[l][p]
e1_010_0295,The number is 63*-****
e1_010_0296,<i>I need a [c4]pen[c0] and a [c4]phone number[c0] for a fax machine[r]so I can call for help.[l][p]
e1_010_0297,<i>I'm sure there's a [c4]pen[c0] around here somewhere.[r]Might as well look for that first.[l][p]
e1_010_0298,<i>I've found a pen, but I should probably make[r]sure it's actually usable.[l][p]
e1_010_0299,<i>I've got a pen, but it's not working...[r]The ink seems to be dried up.[l][p]
e1_010_0300,<i>What should I do...?[r]I can't just keep searching the room aimlessly.[l][p]
e1_010_0301,<i>The pen isn't working.[r]The ink seems to be dried up.[l][p]
e1_010_0302,<i>I could fix it if I had some [c4]nail polish remover[c0]...[r]Let me see what I can find.[l][p]
e1_010_0303,<i>The pen isn't working.[r]The ink seems to be dried up.[l][p]
e1_010_0304,<i>All right, I found some [c4]nail polish remover![c0][r]Let's see if this works![l][p]
e1_010_0305,<i>I have a pen and some paper... Now all I need is[r]a phone number I can send a fax to.[l][p]
e1_010_0306,<i>Do I know of anywhere that has a fax machine...?[l][p]
e1_010_0307,...It happened again! The number for a fax machine[r]just popped into my head![l][p]
e1_010_0308,There's no way all this information is coming[r]from my own brain...[l][p]
e1_010_0309,Could...someone be sending me their thoughts?[l][p]
e1_010_0310,Never mind. I have to focus![r]Let's get this message sent![l][p]
e1_010_0311,Now...[l][p]
e1_010_0312,I need to tell them where I am.[l][p]
e1_010_0313,If I tell them everything I know about this place,[r]they should be able to figure out where it is.[l][p]
e1_010_0314,First, I know I'm in a building owned by Hihaku.[r]A factory or a warehouse.[l][p]
e1_010_0315,As for the address... It should be close to...[l][p]
e1_010_0316,[s0][a1][x0.7]Mayu Chozawa is being held near what location?
e1_010_0317,Komagata Bridge
e1_010_0318,Ryogoku Bridge
e1_010_0319,The Former Yasuda Gardens
e1_010_0320,Ho'onji Bridge
e1_010_0321,Komagata High School
e1_010_0322,The Shigima Residence
e1_010_0323,Kinshibori Park
e1_010_0324,Midoricho Park
e1_010_0325,Candy Shop Sennoya
e1_010_0326,South Warigesui Street
e1_010_0327,Sumida River
e1_010_0328,No, that's not right...[l][p]
e1_010_0329,Think. What was it that I received here?[l][p]
e1_010_0330,That's right... My curse echo is the Beckoning[r]Light. That means this place must be near[r]Ho'onji Bridge.[l][p]
e1_010_0331,Okay, time to send it.[l][p]
e1_010_0332,Uh... I think this is how you do it?[r]
e1_010_0333,All right.[l][p]
e1_010_0334,If the machine I sent it to is connected, it[r]should be sent![l][p]
e1_010_0335,Now...I wait.[r]Please... Somebody...![l][p]
e1_010_0336,[c5]End[c0]
e1_010_0337,<i>I think I've done all that I can do...[l][p]
e1_010_0338,<i>All that's left now is to wait...[l][p]
e1_010_0339,<i>Though... I think there was one part of this[r]room that I never searched.[l][p]
e1_010_0340,Did the fax work...? I can only hope the person[r]who gets it will come help me...[l][p]
e1_010_0341,Hajime! Thanks for waiting.[l][p]
e1_010_0342,Aww, what's wrong? You're wasting that handsome[r]face of yours looking like that.[l][p]
e1_010_0343,...Hm? You think?[l][p]
e1_010_0344,I think I'm still plenty handsome.[l][p]
e1_010_0345,Ahaha! Can't argue with that.[l][p]
e1_010_0346,Are you not meeting with that girl today?[r]Hitomi, I mean.[l][p]
e1_010_0347,Nah... She's off doing who knows what.[l][p]
e1_010_0348,That's too bad. I just found a hair catalogue[r]I thought would be perfect for her.[l][p]
e1_010_0349,Seems like you're pretty worried about her.[l][p]
e1_010_0350,Yeah... She reminds me of myself at that age.[r]I can't help but worry.[l][p]
e1_010_0351,You think? I'd say she's a little ball of[r]sunshine compared to what you were like.[l][p]
e1_010_0352,Shut up. I'm talking emotionally. She needs[r]an adult who can understand how she feels.[l][p]
e1_010_0353,She's like a kitten. She thinks everyone around[r]her is out to get her, so she bites at them all.[l][p]
e1_010_0354,Huh. You might be right.[l][p]
e1_010_0355,So tell her I wanted to see her, will you?[l][p]
e1_010_0356,Sure. I'll do that. But...[l][p]
e1_010_0357,This other girl I ran into the other day is a[r]tough case...[l][p]
e1_010_0358,Oh? She must really be something else if you[r]don't know how to deal with her.[l][p]
e1_010_0359,No, it's not really that kind of thing...[l][p]
e1_010_0360,Some people just have so much misfortune thrown[r]at them.[l][p]
e1_010_0361,What do you mean by that?[l][p]
e1_010_0362,Well, I can't really get into the details...[l][p]
e1_010_0363,But she might have the [c3]talisman[c0] I've been[r]looking for.[l][p]
e1_010_0364,Said it was a memento from her father...[r]Could we really be related?[l][p]
e1_010_0365,But it's not like I can just take it from her.[l][p]
e1_010_0366,What are you mumbling about?[l][p]
e1_010_0367,Who's related to who?[l][p]
e1_010_0368,Ah... Sorry, it's nothing.[l][p]
e1_010_0369,It's about that thing with your family, isn't it?[l][p]
e1_010_0370,Is she the one who has [c3]piece of the book[c0] that[r]your ancestor left behind?
e1_010_0371,...![l][p]
e1_010_0372,Mayu... How do you know that...?[l][p]
e1_010_0373,God, I forget how dense you are sometimes.[r]How long have we been dating now?[l][p]
e1_010_0374,Besides, you were the one who came crying to me[r]about it when you got wasted that one time.[l][p]
e1_010_0375,Rambling about how this old book you're supposed[r]to inherit is hidden in these two talismans...[l][p]
e1_010_0376,And that something was giving you a bad feeling[r]about it and you need to be careful.[l][p]
e1_010_0377,Oh... Right...[l][p]
e1_010_0378,That's all I know, though. And I wasn't planning[r]to try and pry any further.[l][p]
e1_010_0379,But if it's something important you need to protect,[r]then what are you waffling about?[l][p]
e1_010_0380,...Yeah. You're right.[l][p]
e1_010_0381,Thanks, Mayu. I feel better now.[l][p]
e1_010_0382,Oh, that's right! Did you hear? The Mocking Birds[r]were seen in Honjo![l][p]
e1_010_0383,Huh!? That came out of nowhere![r]Mocking...what now?[l][p]
e1_010_0384,It's an urban legend about these bird stickers[r]that show up out of nowhere.[l][p]
e1_010_0385,I was always kind of curious about 'em, but I[r]never thought they'd be in Honjo![l][p]
e1_010_0386,There may be a bunch showing up all over town,[r]so we gotta keep an eye out![l][p]
e1_010_0387,...You feeling all right? What's gotten into you?[l][p]
e1_010_0388,What's so special about these birds?[l][p]
e1_010_0389,Come on! One of 'em is a penguin with a pompadour![r]You can't tell me that isn't the greatest thing you've[r]ever seen.[l][p]
e1_010_0390,Ahaha! That's so dumb...[l][p]
e1_010_0391,...[l][p]
e1_010_0392,That's right...[l][p]
e1_010_0393,He was trying to protect something left to him...[l][p]
e1_010_0394,Could that be the information that Hihaku[r]wanted...?[l][p]
e1_010_0395,[N:src=Images/pic_namedori03 w=520 h=520 x=0 y=30 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Mocking Bird #3[c0] discovered!
e1_010_0396,There's a little sink here. It's pretty dirty.[r]Hope I don't have to use it.[r][l][p]
e1_010_0397,There's water dripping from the faucet, but the[r]knobs are stuck. I can't move them in either[r]direction.[l][p]
e1_010_0398,Looks like I definitely won't be using it.[l][p]
e1_010_0399,There's a key to the sink.[l][p]
e1_010_0400,Ah... If I can use this to see what I look like,[r]it might help me remember who I am.[l][p]
e1_010_0401,Ugh, no good...[l][p]
e1_010_0402,This mirror is completely unusable with all the[r]grime that's built up on it.[l][p]
e1_010_0403,I wonder if I could clean it somehow...[l][p]
e1_010_0404,As long as that grime is there, I have no way of[r]seeing what I look like...[l][p]
e1_010_0405,...Oh! I could use this [c4]soap[c0] to clean off that[r]grime.[l][p]
e1_010_0406,I should've known that just putting soap on[r]the mirror wouldn't do anything.[l][p]
e1_010_0407,I need something to wipe it with...[l][p]
e1_010_0408,From what I can see, I'm not hurt.[r]I just look like crap.[l][p]
e1_010_0409,So why was I brought here...?[l][p]
e1_010_0410,No, Mayu. This isn't the time to start feeling[r]sorry for yourself.[l][p]
e1_010_0411,Just watch! I'm gonna get out of here in no time.[l][p]
e1_010_0412,...It won't open. Must be locked from the outside.[l][p]
e1_010_0413,So I really am locked in here.[l][p]
e1_010_0414,I don't know what's going on, but I doubt I can[r]afford to take my time here.[l][p]
e1_010_0415,I tried banging on it, but there was no response.[r]Doesn't seem like anybody's out there.[l][p]
e1_010_0416,I still don't hear anyone out there.[l][p]
e1_010_0417,No reason to waste my energy banging and yelling.[l][p]
e1_010_0418,Hajime might be able to bust that lock, but I[r]don't stand a chance.[l][p]
e1_010_0419,There's no opening this door from inside.[r]What do I do...?[l][p]
e1_010_0420,Will someone come and save me...?[l][p]
e1_010_0421,A switchboard. Looking inside, it seems that[r]this room has electricity, at least.[l][p]
e1_010_0422,Does that mean someone is using this place for[r]something?[l][p]
e1_010_0423,Some storage lockers.
e1_010_0424,Open the left locker
e1_010_0425,Open the right locker
e1_010_0426,There's nothing inside, but there's a piece of[r]paper stuck to the front.[l][p]
e1_010_0427,[s0][a0.5]"Chemical...flammable...liquid...ventilation...[r]If leaked...equipment integrity...thoroughly..."
e1_010_0428,That's quite the collection of words... What could[r]this place be used for?[l][p]
e1_010_0429,There's a bucket and mop in the left locker.[r]Guess that's where they keep their cleaning stuff.[l][p]
e1_010_0430,Oh, I might be able to use these cleaning[r]supplies.[l][p]
e1_010_0431,I can fill the bucket with soap and use the mop[r]to clear away most of the grime.[l][p]
e1_010_0432,[N:src=Images/itm_mop w=300 h=300 x=0 y=40 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Soapy Mop[c0] acquired
e1_010_0433,A locker with cleaning supplies in it. Nothing[r]else seems useful.[l][p]
e1_010_0434,A cabinet straight out of an office. Let's see[r]what happens if I slide this open.[l][p]
e1_010_0435,Looks like there's nothing inside.[l][p]
e1_010_0436,I'll try the drawers, starting from the top.[l][p]
e1_010_0437,Nope. Totally empty.[l][p]
e1_010_0438,Hm?[l][p]
e1_010_0439,This last drawer... It's different from the[r]others.[l][p]
e1_010_0440,There's a [c4]padlock[c0] with a four-digit combination.
e1_010_0441,I have no idea what the combination could be...[r]Better leave it for now.[l][p]
e1_010_0442,This lock looks brand new compared to everything[r]else. Is this room being used for something?[l][p]
e1_010_0443,Four digits, huh... I guess I could try all the[r]numbers from 0000 to 9999, but...[l][p]
e1_010_0444,That'll be my last resort.[l][p]
e1_010_0445,Oh yeah... Takumi said something about this...[l][p]
e1_010_0446,He said he put something in here and locked it.[l][p]
e1_010_0447,So there's probably something in here...[r]Should I try my luck with the lock?[l][p]
e1_010_0448,Enter number
e1_010_0449,Give up
e1_010_0450,The cabinet the fax machine was in. Empty now.[l][p]
e1_010_0451,A bunch of messily stacked cardboard boxes.[l][p]
e1_010_0452,I took a peek inside, but it was too dark to[r]see much. I'll need more light.[l][p]
e1_010_0453,There are strange bottles and bags filled with[r]some kind of powder in the boxes.[l][p]
e1_010_0454,If this place is a factory, these may be their[r]products. There's no telling if they're dangerous[r]or not... Better not touch them.[l][p]
e1_010_0455,What was in these cardboard boxes, again...?[l][p]
e1_010_0456,Ah, disposed bottles and soap. I wonder if there[r]could be...[l][p]
e1_010_0457,There is! [c4]Nail polish remover[c0]! There's no label,[r]but I'm sure that's what this is.[l][p]
e1_010_0458,[N:src=Images/itm_remover w=300 h=300 x=0 y=40 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Nail Polish Remover[c0] acquired
e1_010_0459,All right. So if I use this...[l][p]
e1_010_0460,Nothing particularly useful in these boxes.[l][p]
e1_010_0461,A big shelf. The kind you always see in[r]warehouses and stuff.[l][p]
e1_010_0462,Wish I could find some tools or something,[r]but no such luck...[l][p]
e1_010_0463,A big shelf used in storage spaces.[l][p]
e1_010_0464,I thought there might be some kind of transceiver[r]in here, but it doesn't look like it...[l][p]
e1_010_0465,Just a bunch of junk. Better search elsewhere.[l][p]
e1_010_0466,There's plenty of soap on these shelves, but no[r]nail polish remover...[l][p]
e1_010_0467,Hm? What's this?[l][p]
e1_010_0468,The label's been torn off, but this must be [c4]soap[c0].[r]There's quite a bit left inside.
e1_010_0469,Take
e1_010_0470,Put back
e1_010_0471,Guess I don't really need this.[l][p]
e1_010_0472,I might be able to use this.[r]Might as well keep it on me.[l][p]
e1_010_0473,[N:src=Images/itm_bottle w=300 h=300 x=0 y=40 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Soap[c0] acquired
e1_010_0474,A typical office desk. There's all kinds of[r]stationery on it.[l][p]
e1_010_0475,Is there anything that looks usable?[l][p]
e1_010_0476,There's this [c4]pen[c0]... But I don't really need it.[r]I'll leave it here for now.[l][p]
e1_010_0477,Alright. I've got a [c4]pen[c0].[r]Now I can write a message![l][p]
e1_010_0478,[N:src=Images/itm_pen w=300 h=300 x=0 y=40 align=ct][r][r][r][r][r][c3]Pen[c0] acquired
e1_010_0479,Though... I better check that it actually works.[l][p]
e1_010_0480,Doesn't seem like anything else on the desk[r]would be useful.[l][p]
e1_010_0481,Open the top drawer

CHR01_ST_0005,Shogo is an unremarkable young man entering his third year of working in the planning department at Hihaku Soaps, a chemicals company headquartered in Sumida.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Born in western Tokyo to an ordinary family around the same time as the birth of color TV, he grew up amidst the boom of special effects-heavy action films, anime, variety shows, professional baseball, and pop music.[r]Shogo graduated from a famous private university in Tokyo, and has since settled into an apolitical mindset—common among those of his generation—with no strong ideals and no particular dissatisfaction with the world as it develops around him. He is content to just go with the flow, having stumbled into his current position by pure chance, and it is safe to assume he will follow the stereotypical path of working his way up the ladder, starting a family, and remaining at the same company until retirement.[r]He plays folk guitar as a hobby and is currently looking for a girlfriend.

CHR02_ST_0003,[c4]Curse Echo: [c0]???[c0]
CHR02_ST_0004,After obtaining a junior college degree, Yoko started working as a housekeeper. Due to her ability to see things other cannot, she has received strange looks from a young age. This ability spurred an interest in the paranormal which she continues to pursue to this day.
CHR02_ST_0005,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Following graduation, Yoko worked a desk job at a trading company, but butted heads with her supervisor—who was skeptical of the supernatural—and quit within a year.[r]Now, while working as a housekeeper, she spends her days devouring mystery magazines and visiting haunted spots.[r]As she vowed to live life true to herself and never change for the sake of others, Yoko has no regrets about the path she has taken.[r]Yoko has a dog—a Shiba Inu named Ogopogo who has been by her side since she was a student.
CHR02_ST_0006,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]In truth, Yoko is a descendant of onmyoji who continue to practice in modern times. Her ancestor, [c4]Ashino[c0], attempted to steal the Rite of Resurrection in Honjo during the Edo period.[r]Born with exceptional spirit sense, Yoko learned about her own ancestry while researching her roots, and was disappointed to find her bloodline had fallen into mediocrity. She became consumed with the ambition to restore her family's lost glory through her own powers, and devised a scheme to succeed where Ashino failed and perform the Rite of Resurrection.[r]Yoko continued her training, developing her spiritual and curse powers until she discovered the Record of Fates, which offered clues regarding the Rite. She plotted to use the curses of the Seven Mysteries of Honjo to gather a large number of soul dregs by calling forth curse echoes and setting the stage for mutual slaughter. The ultimate plan involved invoking a large-scale Feast of Shadows, awakening the curses, performing the Rite herself, and bringing together enough soul dregs to revive Ashino.[r]Since the effects of the curses increase the more people know and fear them, she first entrusted the Record of Fates to local historian Hideki Araishi, who could be used to easily spread the rumors. She also contacted [c4]Fumichika Nejima[c0], a criminal with a deep understanding of mystic arts, to obtain the curse stones needed to gather soul dregs. Unsurprisingly, Nejima was very interested in the story of Ashino, and readily agreed to aid his revival.[r]While carrying out these steps, Yuko learned of the existence of the Yin Scroll, which threatened to thwart her plans. She added a note about the scroll in the Record of Fates before giving it to Araishi, intending to acquire it before it could pose an issue.[r]Through her investigations, Yoko discovered that [c4]Hajime Yoshimi[c0] was a descendant of Seiman, and threatened him with a curse in an effort to scare him into revealing the whereabouts of the Yin Scroll. While Hajime bravely resisted Yoko's threats, she killed him with the curse to ensure Seiman's descendant would not stand in her way.[r]As her preparations were coming together, Yoko obtained the seemingly less dangerous curse stone of the Whispering Canal in order to become a curse bearer—a necessity for gathering the curse stones for the Feast of Shadows. Shogo Okiie, also a descendant of Seiman, was eyed as a potential risk factor, and contacted to ensure he would be located nearby and subject to monitoring. However, unaware that the spirit of Seiman would be awakened within Shogo as soon as she invoked the curse, Yoko's plan was thwarted when she was immediately cursed to death by Seiman.

CHR03_ST_0003,[c4]Curse Echo: [c0]The Haunting Clappers[c0]
CHR03_ST_0004,Harue is a housewife who resides in a manor near Shumoku Bridge.[r]Her eleven-year-old son, Shuichi, was kidnapped and murdered about a year ago. The death was the result of a mistake on the part of the detective assigned to the case—a mistake which enraged the kidnapper and had him cut off all contact with the police, leaving no room for negotiation.[r]The incident was covered up and Shuichi's killer remains at large, leading the aggrieved Harue to call on the services of private investigator [c4]Richter Kai[c0] to uncover the truth.
CHR03_ST_0005,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]The Shigima family came from a line of samurai who built their residence in Honjo during the Edo period. They assumed important positions in the police force following the Meiji Revolution, thereby protecting their family's elevated status. Even today, many in the Shigima line work as police bureaucrats and senior police officers. Harue's father sits in the upper echelons of the National Police Agency, and her husband, adopted into the Shigima clan through an arranged marriage, is also a highly respected Agency official.[r]However, as her family prioritizes work above all else, it wasn't long before Harue's marriage grew cold. Though she wants for nothing, she is isolated from her neighbors and withdrawn from society. Seeing her son grow into a young man gave Harue a purpose in life, but it was cut short by the kidnapping incident.[r]Following the incident, Harue spent many days in a deep depression, breaking into sudden fits of shouting and wandering around in the middle of the night. Her cheerful, loving disposition faded away, and she took to making snide remarks at her husband, which only further soured their relationship.[r]A few months ago, Harue's husband was transferred to another area for work and now rarely returns home, with Harue left to live in the large, empty mansion alone. As a housekeeper who has been with the family for a long time comes in to take care of all the housework, Harue has nothing but time on her hands.

CHR04_ST_0005,The eccentric man that Shogo Okiie ran into at Ho'onji Bridge.
CHR04_ST_0006,[r]Richter is actually a private investigator with an office in Ota City, Tokyo.[r]After taking on a request from [c4]Harue Shigima[c0] to investigate the unsolved kidnapping and murder of her son, he gets caught up in the events surrounding the Rite of Resurrection.
CHR04_ST_0007,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Once a police officer, Richter was wracked with guilt over the police's inability to help all those in need, and quit the force to start his own private investigation firm. However, his softhearted nature leads him to take on too many cases and has put his office in dire financial straits. How he is still in business is a mystery, with some whispering that a wealthy patron is keeping him afloat.[r]Richter studied alongside detective [c4]Jun Erio[c0] at the police academy.[r]Somewhat surprisingly—given his outlandish clothing and mannerisms—Richter excels at covert investigations and tailing his targets. He proudly refers to himself as an investigator extraordinaire, though that only ever succeeds at impressing himself.[r]Richter's biggest source of happiness is nuzzling his pet female albino parakeet—Ernestine—which he keeps in his office. He also enjoys collecting Mocking Bird stickers, a popular line of merchandise featuring birds inexplicably dressed like delinquents, and can be frequently sighted searching around town for them.[r]While out and about, Richter typically leaves the office (and, more importantly, Ernestine) in the care of Amamori, a junior high schooler who volunteered to assist Richter after being involved in a previous case.

CHR05_ST_0006,[r]Tetsuo is a veteran detective with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, First Investigative Division.[r]He was possessed by the Evergreen Beech curse echo while investigating the Former Yasuda Gardens.[r]Previously a member of the secret Paranormal Affairs Bureau within the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Security Division, he makes use of this experience to investigate the ongoing large-scale curse incident with his partner, [c4]Jun Erio[c0].
CHR05_ST_0007,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Rather than sitting behind a desk, Chief Inspector Tsutsumi always worked in the field as he moved his way up the police force. Behind his stern face lies a compassionate man ever prepared to help his fellow officers. That same attentiveness to his work and colleagues, however, cost Tetsuo his marriage several years ago.[r]Tetsuo has a penchant for candy and desserts, which he tries (but fails) to conceal from other officers at the risk of appearing soft. He delights in buying local sweets wherever he is sent to investigate a case and would often volunteer to be dispatched to distant locations to acquire them while he was with the Paranormal Affairs Bureau. He is also surprisingly knowledgeable about current trends, a trait he puts down to investigation-related research, but which is actually spurred by his wish to have something to discuss with his daughter.

CHR06_ST_0006,[r]Jun is a young detective with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, First Investigative Division with the rank of sergeant.[r]Jun encountered a curse echo while investigating the mysterious death of his colleague, [c4]Hajime Yoshimi[c0], in the Former Yasuda Gardens with [c4]Tetsuo Tsutsumi[c0]. When Tetsuo explained to him that the supernatural is real, he accepted this fact without a moment's hesitation, and vowed to help his partner to solve the case.
CHR06_ST_0007,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Born to a relatively well-off household, Jun developed a healthy sense of self-esteem and an optimistic outlook on life. Although watching action movies and detective series as a child instilled in him a desire to help those in need, it was the sight of Tetsuo Tsutsumi—who was in charge of investigating a case Jun was involved in as a student—that truly inspired him to become a police officer. While Jun still maintains a strong respect for Tetsuo, he also gets much enjoyment out of making casual cracks to get a rise out of the veteran officer.[r]As an adult, Jun continues to hold on to the faint hope that the world is as he pictured it in his youth—a thrilling place in which superhuman heroes do battle against secret evil organizations.[r]He attended the police academy with [c4]Richter Kai[c0], who is now a private investigator. The two initially became friendly when Jun found Richter holed up alone in the reference room scouring over old crime data, and invited him to go bowling, a popular pastime during this era.

CHR07_ST_0005,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Once a rebellious gang member himself, Yoshimi turned his life around and used his own experiences to connect with troubled youth as a police officer.[r]While his appearance and demeanor suggested a man who was rough around the edges, he was a passionate, loyal and caring man at heart, looked up to as a big brother by his peers. Yoshimi achieved stellar results in his work with juvenile cases, but his consistently sloppy paperwork and less than formal attitude essentially doomed his career and had him writing formal apologies on the regular.[r]He left behind a fiancée whom he had been dating since high school.

CHR08_ST_0005,Mio transferred to Class 2C at Komagata High School about two months ago. Although she is an extremely mild-mannered young woman, she exudes a somewhat off-putting dark aura which makes it difficult for her to form friendships. Mio has, however, found a friend in her classmate [c4]Yakko Sakazaki[c0], and has begun opening up to her little by little.
CHR08_ST_0006,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]The truth of the matter is that Mio is the apprentice of a famous psychic. Possessing exceptional spirit sense, she takes on the troublesome task of surreptitiously handling spiritual disturbances that break out in schools across Tokyo before they become a problem. She transfers schools frequently as a result, and thus has trouble making human friends.[r]Mio has already solved an incident at Komagata High School involving a female student possessed by a spirit.[r]Although she takes effort to hide her spirit sense, many develop an impression that Mio has a deep knowledge of the occult and the paranormal upon first meeting her—leading her to be anxious that her secrets have been exposed. The most common comment she receives is that she seems to get along well with crows and black cats.

CHR09_ST_0006,Yakko is a student in Class 2C at Komagata High School. Unable to comprehend why her childhood friend and classmate, [c4]Michiyo Shiraishi[c0], committed suicide, she attempted to investigate the incident herself. However, she was unable to make any progress and, feeling desperate, invited transfer student [c4]Mio Kurosuzu[c0] to join her in performing a spirit board ritual.
CHR09_ST_0007,[r]Yakko was possessed by Michiyo's spirit a few days ago, which caused her own thoughts to become muddled with Michiyo's. However, upon grasping what Michiyo was seeking to tell her and bringing peace to her lost friend, Yakko returned to her normal self.
CHR09_ST_0008,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Born and raised in Honjo, Sumida City, Yakko's family has owned and operated the beloved Candy Shop Sennoya since its establishment in the early Showa era. Despite her modest appearance, Yakko is a cheerful and vivacious young woman with a sense of duty and compassion so strong that she is easily moved to tears. She is also a bit quick-tempered and quarrelsome, always prepared to stand up against those who harm her family or friends. It is possible, however, that this readiness to fight is more driven by an innate love of chaos.[r]Yakko's winning streak against arrogant boys in scraps since she was a child remains unbroken, and is the source of considerable stress for her mother.

CHR10_ST_0004,Michiyo was a second-year student at Komagata High School. She was found deceased one week ago in a back alley off South Warigesui Street, her entire body broken and severely contorted.[r]Police determined that Michiyo committed suicide by jumping from a nearby apartment building. As there was no suicide note, the police based their conclusion on interviews with Michiyo's peers.
CHR10_ST_0005,[r]Subsequent investigation revealed that Michiyo was in fact killed by [c4]Yutaro Namigaki[c0] in a hit-and-run accident. It was also revealed that she unwillingly aided and abetted the kidnapping of Shuichi Shigima after being subjected to physical threats and violence by [c4]Kankichiro Iwai[c0].
CHR10_ST_0006,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Michiyo was an honor student with a good head on her shoulders and consistently excellent grades, making her a favorite among the teachers. Although she appeared somewhat reserved, she had a positive outlook on life and a courageous spirit.[r]Michiyo and [c4]Yakko[c0] formed a long-lasting friendship during childhood, with Yakko's unbending, uncompromising attitude deeply influencing Michiyo. However, beneath her strong exterior, Michiyo had been pushing herself too hard and keeping her emotions bottled up to the point that they risked overflowing.[r]Following her father's death three years ago and moving to a new house, Michiyo began avoiding Yakko. Although the two remained in the same area of town and attended the same high school, they gradually grew further apart.[r]Yakko herself worried for her childhood friend, but, incapable of wading into complexities of Michiyo's home life, kept her distance. The days passed, and though Michiyo longed to confess everything to Yakko, the moment to do so never came.[r]Michiyo carried an old talisman—a memento of her father—with her at all times.

Recently, some teachers have taken to using harsher measures and even corporal punishment to correct Hitomi's behavior, but this has only served to exacerbate the animosity between Hitomi and the school.[r]Hitomi is widely regarded as the leader of the troublemakers at Komagata High School, but the title does not mean much to her.

CHR20_ST_0005,[r]His deceased body was discovered at the Shiraishi home.
CHR20_ST_0006,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Kankichiro once made a living by placing advertisements in magazines to sell phony magic items and good luck charms. He held a nostalgic yearning for the postwar era when things and people were simple, and has nothing but negative things to say about the rapidly developing, ostentatious world of late. Radical in his belief that it would be better to tear down society and start over again, Kankichiro was discontent with his life spent poking around in society's cesspools to make a few coins.[r]When the Nejima Murders were widely reported in the media, it had a great impact on Kankichiro, as he witnessed how a single act by a single man could cause a major rift in society. Perceiving Fumichika Nejima as a great hero, he began collecting every piece of information he could find on the man.[r]Kankichiro was later arrested for his illegal business practices, and a chance meeting with Fumichika during his incarceration solidified his idolization. He was captivated by Fumichika's talk of black magic, and, following his release, acquired the grimoire Fumichika had hidden away.[r]As for Toshiko Shiraishi, Kankichiro set his sights on her after encountering her at her part-time job. When he learned that the Shiraishi family was in financial trouble and could not afford to send Michiyo to college, he turned on the charm and took advantage of their weakness by offering them money. He revealed his true colors, however, after moving in with the family, and used violence and money to keep Toshiko and Michiyo under his thumb. All the while, his belief in black magic deepened, and he found a sponsor in the Hihaku corporation. Kankichiro forced the Shiraishi family to perform various rituals, with any attempts to resist being met with merciless beatings. The mother and daughter were helpless to resist.[r]After Hihaku offered Kankichiro great sums to intensify his work with black magic, he set his mind to sacrificing a child in order to perform a youth restoration spell. For this purpose, he chose Shuichi Shigima—the son of Harue Shigima, against whom Fumichika held a grudge. He attempted to enlist Michiyo so as not to alarm the boy, and when she resisted, beat her mother twenty times. With Michiyo's assistance, Kankichiro kidnapped Shuichi and locked him up in the Shiraishi house, and told the young and courageous boy that he'd kill Michiyo if he tried to run.[r]While his actions were motivated by a personal grudge against the police, it was first and foremost an attempt to create a societal uproar and breakdown in public order—so Kankichiro painted the crime as a regular kidnapping, demanding a ransom from the family. However, because of an embargo on the press, the kidnapping did not cause a public outcry akin to that of the Nejima Murders. Infuriated, Kankichiro had Toshiko perform the sacrifice ritual by threatening to kill Michiyo if she refused. Toshiko killed Shuichi in his sleep, but the spell failed, for which Kankichiro blamed her.[r]Warning Michiyo to keep silent about the murder to avoid incriminating her mother, Kankichiro dumped the boy's body in a nearby river. The tiny corpse was found a week later in the Sumida River after floating through several canals in Honjo. Having drifted for days in the polluted waters, little evidence remained.[r]Although Kankichiro performed no further sacrifices, his devotion to black magic only increased. Toshiko and Michiyo spent their days consumed by guilt, forced to continue serving Kankichiro until the day they died.

CHR22_ST_0005,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Fumichika first began believing in miracles when he voluntarily enlisted in World War II as a teenager and was the only POW in his unit to survive. By the time the war ended and he was freed, he had learned some English and gained considerable weight from the food he was given in captivity.[r]Upon returning to Japan, Fumichika found that the area in which his parents' house was located in Tokyo had been burned to the ground, and his entire family wiped out in the disaster. Starting over from nothing, he worked hard and eventually opened a small general store near the Sumida River. Though it was not a thriving business, it was enough to put food on the table.[r]Fumichika was inspired by the new cultural trends flooding into the city as Tokyo was rebuilt from the ashes. He was especially fond of books, and enjoyed visiting antique bookstores in Kanda to search for rare foreign books in his free time. Of all books, however, it was those on the paranormal and the occult that caught his eye, as he was already open to the existence of such things due to his miraculous return from the war. What was initially a passing interest gradually became a deep fascination with Western black magic as he gathered more information on the subject.[r]Still single after 30, Fumichika tried performing a black magic ritual to summon a partner. Soon after, he met a woman who called herself [c4]Shino[c0], though her real name remains unknown. Shino had left her hometown in the countryside where she had no family or work to support her, and somehow made it to Tokyo while earning a meager daily wage. When she met Fumichika, she was haggard and on the verge of starvation. Fumichika, who felt a connection with Shino due to the ritual, decided to take her into his home and let her live there. Both of them having lived alone for most of their lives, the two turned out to be a perfect match.[r]Shino gradually recovered, but still was not strong enough to work. Fumichika was by no means a skilled businessman, and their lives were far from financially secure, but Shino, who had experienced wartime Japan, was simply content to have food on the table to eat every day. The two spent their days together, poor but happy to be by each other's sides.[r]Several years later, Shino's condition took a severe turn for the worse. The local doctor could offer them no help and, without enough money to take Shino to a major hospital, Fumichika resorted to using black magic to heal her. However, it was of no use, and she passed away at their home. Her final words were: "I'm sorry I must go first. I'll leave the rest to you."[r]Fumichika plunged into intense despair. He drank and ate everything he could to distract himself, which caused him to rapidly gain weight. After a while, when he was finally able to walk around town once more, he found himself drawn to an antique bookstore, within which he found a grimoire he had never laid eyes on before. The grimoire contained detailed instructions on how to perform a resurrection through black magic. The rite required the dismemberment and sacrifice of a young woman, but this great cost only served to convince Fumichika that this would be the spell that would finally work. He embraced the grimoire and let its depictions of black magic consume his heart more than ever before.[r]Fumichika then found a destitute woman in town who was on the verge of collapse, brought her to a basement warehouse, and performed the ritual sacrifice. However, it had no effect. Thinking that his own hesitation had got in the way, he was swift to perform the ritual again, but it still proved fruitless. He repeated this process four times in total. Each time, he dismembered the body into small pieces and dumped them into the filthy Sumida River, where they were never found. While cleaning up after his fourth kill, a disappointed Fumichika noticed an emaciated baby nearby.[r]Could it have been...Shino?

While Honjo is known for its large number of rivers and canals, many of these were dug during the area's urbanization for drainage and sewage.[r]The Ryogoku Bridge area, home to the Eko Temple, eventually became filled with both people and shops. After a magistrate was assigned to the area and shops continued to pop up, it soon became a part of Edo proper as its reputation as a lively place spread.[r]Honjo, along with other areas like Asakusa and Fukukawa, are still appreciated today for their old-fashioned feel and architecture.

Their roots likely come from stories told by the city's common folk. The most famous of the stories is "The Whispering Canal," which eventually became the basis for both an idiom and a well-known Rakugo story.

DOC05_ST_0004,[r]Formerly known as [c3]Kinshibori[c0], many fishermen once gathered on this section of the canal that ran through Honjo.[r]As their days came to a close and the fishermen gathered up their catches, a terrifying voice would rise up from the canal, whispering, "Leave it behind... Leave it behind..."[r]Those who ignored the voice found themselves unable to move and their previously full baskets of fish emptied. They would then be dragged into he canal, never to return.[r]This strange phenomenon continued to occur, and the people began to call this body of water the Whispering Canal.[r] [r]

DOC05_ST_0009,Toki loved fishing with her father Jinkichi more than anything. With their wicker baskets on their backs, they would leave for the canal every morning and fish till the evening. The miso soup her mother Koma made using the carp they caught was to die for. Her parents loved her dearly.[r]One day, however, her father disappeared. Toki's mother went to look for him and never came back either. Those who came to express their concern eventually stopped visiting her out of fear. Toki continued to wait, all alone.[r]"Mother, Father, where did you go? Don't leave me behind..."[r]Unable to bear the loneliness, she left her home and trudged along the roads until night fell. Neither her mother nor father were anywhere to be found. Tears stung her eyes.[r]Suddenly, the sound of fish splashing in the water cut through the silence. She found herself standing before the canal where they used to fish together. The taste of carp and the memory of her father's smile flashed across her mind. Without thinking, Toki walked into the moat. The sound of water splashing echoed throughout the night air. Passersby thought of it only as the fish in the canal.[r]The splashing faded, and silence returned to the lonely night.

DOC14_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]The Honjo Incident
DOC14_ST_0002,During the Edo period, a chain of events that occurred around a certain resurrection spell became the basis for the Seven Mysteries of Honjo.
DOC14_ST_0003,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]This is a story that takes place in the late Edo period.[r]There was once a family that lived in a row house in Honjo. The family consisted of a netsuke craftsman named [c4]Jinkichi[c0], his wife [c4]Koma[c0], and their daughter [c4]Toki[c0]. They enjoyed a poor but happy existence.[r]One day, they took in a man by the name of [c4][%6][c0], who claimed to be a shomoji. He was on the run, having barely escaped with his life from something or another, and wound up in Honjo. The tough circumstances had left him sick and destitute. Jinkichi felt sorry for the man and decided to shelter him.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]The stranger was deeply grateful for the kindness and care of Jinkichi's family, as without it he would've surely died, and told them thusly on the day of his departure, "I want to give you my thanks, but unfortunately I have nothing of value." He paused, then asked. "Is there anyone you want to bring back to life?"[r]It turned out that the man's true name was Tsuchimikado Seiman, a descendant of renowned onmyoji, and he had been researching the fabled Rite of Resurrection. For his crime in unearthing this forbidden rite, he was chased out by his family, but he wrote down everything about the spell in a book he named the "Record of Fates" while on the run.[r]Whoever sought to perform the rite would need to kill people and gather their soul dregs. Seiman had only researched the rite out of the spirit of inquiry, but thought himself willing to use the rite if it was for the sake of Jinkichi's family.[r]However, Jinkichi shook his head. "Sacrificing someone is unthinkable. We didn't help you because we wanted something in return, so you owe us nothing," he said, declining the unbelievable offer. Seiman bowed his head in gratitude countless times at those words and left their house.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]In the same area there lived an ukiyo-e artist known as [c4]Old Man Kanzo[c0]. His art didn't sell much, but he often looked after Toki while Jinkichi and Koma were out working.[r]Young Toki heard Seiman's talk about the Rite of Resurrection, but—being too young to comprehend it—regaled it to Old Man Kanzo as a story of fiction. Old Man Kanzo, inspired by the story and filled with renewed vigor, put his heart and soul into his next painting. The piece, centered around the theme of resurrection, became an instant hit in town.[r]Jinkichi, being a shrewd businessman, saw an opportunity and jumped on the bandwagon by carving netsuke connected to Old Man Kanzo's ukiyo-e. He made up stories about his netsuke, telling the people that their blessings were connected to resurrection, and his business rapidly flourished.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]"That man unknowingly left us a wonderful gift," thought Jinkichi and his family, but they were unaware of the tragedy that would soon unfold.[r]Before long, word of Old Man Kanzo's wonderful ukiyo-e reached the ears of the local daimyo and he was summoned to the lord's residence. But what awaited him was not praise, but cruel torture at the hands of Ashino, a female onmyoji who was in pursuit of Seiman. It was her who pressured Seiman into researching the Rite of Resurrection, which she secretly planned to use to preserve her beauty for all eternity.[r]Ashino took advantage of the fact that the daimyo's heart was weak and frail following the loss of his family, and manipulated him into capturing Old Man Kanzo, the source of the recent rumors about resurrection.[r]"Tell me where you heard of the Rite of Resurrection!" Ashino demanded, as the brutal beatings continued.[r]It was said that the eerie sound of the beatings rang out like the beating of a taiko drum night after night, reaching even the watchtower of the Tsugaru residence.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]In the end, Ashino's cruel torture secured her the information on Jinkichi's family and the existence of the Record of Fates. The daimyo sent his [c4]chief retainer[c0] to bring in Jinkichi and the torture resumed afresh with the new captive. This time she intended to obtain the whereabouts of Seiman and the location of the Record of Fates. Jinkichi didn't know where Seiman went, but even if he did he had no intention of telling and stubbornly kept his mouth shut. The torture was pushed too far and Jinkichi was unintentionally killed before he spoke a word. The daimyo had Jinkichi's corpse hanged from a beech tree and declared that, "Unable to bear the guilt of the crime of deceiving the masses with false rumors of resurrection, Jinkichi had committed suicide."[r]This too was all part of Ashino's plan to send a message to the common folk, especially the increasing number of those who sought out the Rite for themselves.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]News of what happened to Jinkichi spread and people lost interest in the rite, wondering if the stories of resurrection were all but a lie. But rumors that the daimyo's word was perhaps not all that truthful spread quickly when a dancer claimed to have witnessed the chief retainer's cold-blooded handiwork firsthand, and Honjo fell into unrest once more.[r]The chief retainer arrested the girl and proposed a deal to put a stop to the rumors. The girl was to say she just wanted attention and retract her story by saying it was entirely made up. In exchange she would be given a most wondrous stage to perform on, but when the day came she was suffocated by the mask prepared for the performance. Unbeknownst to her, the mask had been covered in glue as part of the plan to kill and silence her.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Koma never believed for a moment that her husband Jinkichi had committed suicide. She was certain someone was behind his death and asked around persistently for the names, addresses, and any other information she could find on people with connections to the daimyo.[r]The chief retainer would not allow things to escalate any further and had [c4]Tomezo[c0], a ronin who once served as a spy, go after her. However, she turned the table on him, shouting "It was you who killed my husband, wasn't it!?" Confronted with the accusation, Tomezo flew into a blind rage and cut Koma down in broad daylight. Ordered to take responsibility for his failure by committing seppuku, he exposed the daimyo's plot as he disemboweled himself by the lantern of the soba cart used to give coded signals.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]With both her parents gone through means unbeknownst to her, Toki found herself to be all alone. One day, late at night, she went searching for her parents and met her doom falling into a canal where she drowned.[r]Meanwhile, the chief retainer had made no headway whatsoever in finding Seiman's whereabouts, and an incensed Ashino decided to set fire to his residence, burning him alive.[r]In truth, all those connected to these events thus far were cursed by Ashino so that their souls would turn into soul dregs upon death, which she had been collecting. All she needed to perform the Rite now was to get her hands on the Record of Fates.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Sensing that there was something serious at work behind the recent string of strange events in Honjo, Seiman returned to find he was too late. He broke down in tears when he learned of the unfortunate and unnatural deaths Jinkichi's family had met.[r]Seiman realized it was the handiwork of Ashino when he found their soul dregs had been collected, and decided he had to prevent any further sacrifices from happening by confronting her on Ho'on-ji Bridge.[r]What ensued was a fierce battle of spells that endured till the break of dawn, though those who did not know any better only saw what they believed to be eerie flashes and supernatural orbs of light.[r]At the end of the long battle, Ashino defeated Seiman and obtained the Record of Fates, but he had placed a curse upon her foot. Ashino dragged her foot, corrupted and horribly inflamed, and sought refuge at the nearby residence of a retainer and angrily demanded they wash her foot.[r]Ashino died then and there, filled with agony and her foot cursed and rotten. Seiman too, having sustained serious wounds during their fight, died that day on Ho'on-ji Bridge, still filled with regret.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]However, Seiman came back to life. Knowing that there would be enough soul dregs in place during their confrontation, he had prepared a spell that would activate the Rite of Resurrection upon his passing. Feeling that his curiosity was responsible for the terrible tragedy that had unfolded, he was left with a keen understanding of why the Rite of Resurrection was forbidden and became determined to seal it away. Indeed, the reason he'd resurrected himself was for that very purpose.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]However, he did not know what had become of the Record of Fates. With nothing to seal away, he instead used the remaining soul dregs to turn nine of the netsuke made by Jinkichi into ritual implements to be sealed away in Honjo.[r]He placed a spell so that should someone try to activate the Rite of Resurrection again, all nine pieces will awaken at once. And to pass the whole truth of these events to future generations, he wrote everything down in the "Record of Fates Yin Scroll" and passed it down to his descendants.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Meanwhile, the townspeople kept silent about the incidents out of fear of being cursed. However, these occurrences were so strange that gossip about it couldn't truly be contained.[r]Over time, the details became more and more vague as the stories grew into legends...

DOC15_ST_0002,As indicated by its name, this manuscript holds detailed instructions on how to perform the secret art of reviving the dead. This forbidden ritual is said to have been devised by a once-famous onmyoji.[r]Local researcher Hideki Araishi recently discovered the old manuscript and gave a presentation on it at an academic conference, sending ripples through the field of occult studies.
DOC15_ST_0003,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]According to the Record of Fates, this mysterious ritual was devised by the gifted onmyoji Abe no Seimei.[r]It converts the souls of the dead bound for the underworld with soul dregs collected as sacrifices through the Taizan Fukun Ritual. This secret art of converting souls to soul dregs is out of reach to all but the most skilled practitioners.

DOC17_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Curse Echoes/Curse Bearers
DOC17_ST_0002,Curse echoes are the visual manifestations of curses.[r]These manifestations are fundamentally related to the origin of the curse. They do not always take the same shape, and may sometimes appear in a more abstract or disfigured form. They lack consciousness, unlike a spirit, and are thus the mere "dregs" of a soul.[r]Curses are made tangible by what are known as soul dregs. Someone possessed by a curse that has a curse echo is called a curse bearer.
DOC17_ST_0003,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]A curse echo is in itself a curse, and a possessed curse bearer can inflict that curse upon others at will. A curse that comes with a curse echo is considered very powerful in and of itself. Ordinarily, those with no spirit sense would not be able to perceive a curse echo, but anyone who becomes a curse bearer can see other curse echoes.

DOC19_ST_0002,When someone dies, their life essence leaves the body and becomes a soul. If one is killed by means of certain curses, however, their life essence will turn into a residue known as "soul dregs."[r]The Rite of Resurrection essentially uses these soul dregs as a sacrificial offering to bring back the dead, but the amount of soul dregs required depends on when the person being resurrected passed away.

DOC26_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]The Shigima Kidnapping (Overview)
DOC26_ST_0002,A kidnapping and murder case that took place in Honjo, Sumida around one year ago.[r]Harue Shigima's son, Shuichi (age eleven), was kidnapped on his way home from school, with a ransom being demanded that same evening.[r]Initially, the kidnapping was thought of as a simple extortion scheme, but when it came to light that the Shigima family was closely tied to the police—and Shuichi was in fact the grandson of a senior official—it was quickly assumed that the perpetrator was acting upon a grudge against the police force.[r]The kidnapping was treated as a direct attack against the good name of the police, and a large-scale investigation was launched that used the best equipment available to trace phone calls.[r]This made it all the more embarrassing when they were unable to catch the culprit, losing the public's confidence.[r]The culprit grew cocky, relentlessly mocking the police force.[r]After three days of failure after failure, Harue reached a breaking point.[r]Spurred by concern for her son, she resolved to hand over the ransom money as fast as possible, but her husband and father—who held the prestige of the police in high regard—refused, saying that they would not let the criminal win by giving in to their demands.[r]The increasingly frantic detective assigned to the case lost his temper when the criminal called to give an ultimatum, causing the culprit to never make contact again.[r]Another week passed, and Shuichi's body was found floating in the Sumida River.[r]Shuichi's death could be largely ascribed to the police's incompetence, but this was ultimately covered up with stringent media embargoes.[r]The investigation was never closed, but the case has long gone cold.
DOC26_ST_0003,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Subsequent investigations revealed that the culprit was in fact, Kankichiro Iwai, an unemployed man.[r]Toshiko Shiraishi, his common-law wife, and Michiyo Shiraishi, their daughter, acted as accomplices.[r]Kankichiro routinely used violence against both Toshiko and Michiyo to force them to do his bidding, and it is believed that he coerced them into becoming accessories to the crime.[r]Kankichiro wanted to use the boy as a living sacrifice for his magical studies, meaning that the ransom was never actually the primary motive for the kidnapping.[r]The reason for targeting the Shigima family's son was due to a personal grievance.
DOC27_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Sumida River
DOC27_ST_0002,A Class A river that is part of the Arakawa River system, which runs through much of Eastern Tokyo and empties into Tokyo Bay.[r]During the Edo period, Sumida's riverbanks played a key role in the transportation of lumber used for construction.[r]In addition to its logistical importance, it was also a place for the common folk to gather and enjoy activities such as seasonal flower viewing or river bathing, and there exist many woodblock prints depicting such activities.[r]The area became plagued with sewage issues when the surrounding environs were industrialized in the postwar period, but the situation has improved since.[r]Many unique bridges span the Sumida River, including the Ryogoku and Azumabashi bridges, which attract a large number of visitors as sightseeing spots.[r]Massive fireworks displays in the summer are also always sure to draw a crowd.[r]The river has served as a cornerstone for both the city and its people, having both aided in its development, and serving as an inspiring backdrop for countless works of art and literature.
DOC28_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Ryogoku Bridge
DOC28_ST_0002,The second-oldest of the many bridges spanning the Sumida River, behind Senju Ohashi.[r]During the Great Fire of Meireki in 1657 (which destroyed 60–70% of Edo), many drowned in the Sumida River attempting to swim away from the flames, resulting in the building of bridges to be a major focus of the reconstruction efforts.[r]Although this bridge was simply known as Ohashi (or "Great Bridge") when it was first erected, the people of Edo took to calling it Ryogoku Bridge (or "Two-Nations Bridge") due to its location between the provinces of Musashi and Shimosa, and this eventually became its official name.[r]Over time, the wide roads at either side—originally intended as firebreaks—became popular locations for street performances and other events.[r]The bridge was rebuilt following the Great Kanto Earthquake and still stands to this day.
DOC29_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Komagata Bridge
DOC29_ST_0002,One of the bridges spanning the Sumida River. Completed in 1927 as part of the reconstruction effort following the Great Kanto Earthquake, it is notable both for its distinctive blue arches and the cutting-edge—for the time—techniques used in its construction.[r]There are many bridges stretching across the Sumida River, each boasting a unique structural form and design.
DOC30_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]South Warigesui Street
DOC30_ST_0002,A warigesui (lit. "partitioning ditch") refers to a waterway dug down the middle of a road so as to divide it.[r]At the dawn of the Edo period, the Honjo district was little more than a collection of suburban rice farms. As the area became more developed, the South Warigesui was excavated in order to drain rainwater into the Yokojikken River to the east. Though it served the people long and faithfully, it was converted into an underground culvert at the beginning of the Showa era.[r]In the present, no trace of it remains on the surface but the street that bears its name.
DOC31_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Kinshibori Park
DOC31_ST_0002,Opened 1950.[r]Conveniently close to Kinshicho Station and surrounded on all sides by roads, this paved park is a popular spot for people to meet or relax.[r]Kinshibori Park was named after the Kinshibori canal, part of the South Warigesui canal which could once be found nearby.[r]In fact, the area's name, Kinshicho, was also derived from the canal.
DOC32_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Former Yasuda Gardens
DOC32_ST_0002,A lush green park administered by Sumida City. As is common in traditional Japanese gardens, its large central pond is shaped like the character for "heart."[r]The paths that crisscross its grounds, lined with stone lanterns, are perfect for strolling while appreciating the foliage or bird-watching.[r]The gardens once pulled in water from the Sumida River so that its pond would ebb and flow with the tide—a novelty in Edo, which had begun filling in the bay to support its expansion—but the practice has been discontinued in modern times due to flood prevention measures.
DOC33_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Midoricho Park
DOC33_ST_0002,A small park bordering South Warigesui Street, sporting a mixture of cherry and evergreen trees.[r]Although unremarkable in most respects, its small playground always attracts a number of children come evening.[r]While no trace remains in the modern day, it stands on what was once the site of the Tsugaru estate.[r]The legendary artist Katsushika Hokusai is also believed to have been born in the vicinity.
DOC34_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Komagata High School
DOC34_ST_0002,A coeducational municipal high school with 632 attendees. Its name is commonly shortened to Koma High.[r]Although it opened as Honjo First Middle School in 1943, subsequent revisions to its enrollment policies saw it change its name, becoming Komagata High School.[r]The school strives to instill its students with the "three S's of Sumida": sound morals, social responsibility, and strength of spirit—but success has been limited. Plagued by delinquency, it has been forced to turn to temporary employees to compensate for its high staff turnover, and its sports clubs face challenges with its inner-city location and small campus. Its Traditional Culture Research Club is thriving, however, even issuing regular bulletins in collaboration with a local records office.
DOC35_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Shigima Residence
DOC35_ST_0002,Once a warrior clan with a mansion in Honjo, now a dynasty of police officials, the Shigima family is one of considerable repute.[r]The family estate was originally located some distance from the city, but the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 forced them to rebuild in a new location.[r]The Shigima mansion was at one time a bustling place where members of the social elite mingled. One year ago, however, the head of the house was struck with a sudden melancholy, and ever since their mansion has stood silent as the grave.
DOC36_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Kurokikyo Cafe
DOC36_ST_0002,A coffee shop on South Warigesui Street. Kurokikyo Cafe's convenient location has made it a favorite of businessmen in the neighborhood.[r]Although formerly a relaxing location where classical and jazz music were played, the cafe has begun incorporating some pop songs into its playlist at the request of customers.[r]The most popular menu item is a pilaf served with black coffee, although cream soda topped with a large scoop of ice cream is also a popular choice.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Fashionable cafes featuring jazz and live performances were in vogue until the mid-Showa era, when the number of cafes offering a carefully brewed cup of coffee in a relaxed atmosphere began to increase. Many of these locations also have public telephones, making them convenient meeting places. However, they also developed a reputation as hangout spots for delinquents, leading a large number of schools to forbid their students from patronizing them.[r]In recent years, table arcade games have become a big hit, affording cafes installing them a steady stream of customers.
DOC37_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Candy Shop Sennoya
DOC37_ST_0002,An old-fashioned candy shop located on a street corner in Honjo. It has been in Yakko Sakazaki's family for three generations.[r]On the weekends, you can spot Yakko watching over the store, cooking monjayaki and playing traditional tops and card games with the local children.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Though traditional candy shops are known for selling cheap treats for kids, it is not uncommon to see these largely privately-owned businesses become something more like general stores, selling food, drinks, utensils, and other daily necessities.[r]Many families operate candy shops on the dirt ground floor of their home (known as a "doma"), with a space in the back where customers can eat monjayaki, as well as arcade games and capsule toy machines in the front. Such facilities make them attractive places for children to gather and play.[r]However, the harsh reality is that traditional candy shops, which thrived during the period of high economic growth when many confectionery manufacturers entered the market, are experiencing a steady decline due to the rise of convenience stores and changes in children's interests and tastes.
DOC38_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Katsushika Hokusai
DOC38_ST_0002,A master ukiyo-e artist. 1760–1849.[r]Hokusai was active during the late Edo period, considered to be the golden age of ukiyo-e in Japan.[r]Born in Honjo, Hokusai spent most of his life in the area now known as Sumida City.[r]Among his most famous works are the "Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji" and the "Hokusai Manga."[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Hokusai was a prolific artist from a young age and has left behind a wide variety of works, producing an estimated 30,000 pieces during his lifetime.[r]Though the general popularity of ukiyo-e declined during the Meiji period, Hokusai remained a core figure at the center of the Japonisme movement, providing inspiration for countless artists around the globe.[r]Despite his fame, Hokusai himself was said to be rather indifferent to money or decorum, and lived a life that quite appropriately resembled that of the whimsical and otherworldly scenes often depicted in ukiyo-e. Though he went by many names, in his later years he took on the title of "Gakyo Rojin Manji," or "the Old Mad Painter."[r]Hokusai lived to be ninety years old, and never lost his passion for art.

DOC40_ST_0002,Although officially called the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Security Division, Special Security Unit, Paranormal Affairs Bureau, it is more commonly referred to simply as Paranormal Affairs. Only a handful of people know of its existence, even within the police force.[r]As the name suggests, it specializes in the investigation and resolution of cases involving paranormal phenomena. Since the existence of paranormal phenomena is not public knowledge, nor is it readily believed by the general population, the bureau's activities are conducted in the utmost secrecy. Currently, there are only five members, including the chief. The bureau has a network of psychic contacts across the country who assist with their cases, including Mio Kurosuzu.[r]The bureau undertakes investigations into any suspicious stories that cross their desk, though the vast majority turn out to be hoaxes. Due to the sheer volume of cases, close-lipped, experienced detectives without paranormal abilities of their own, such as Tetsuo Tsutsumi, are sometimes assigned to investigate.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]The current chief of Paranormal Affairs is a man named [c4]Kuiru Nakagoshi[c0]. He was born to a family of psychics who have been involved in keeping the world safe from paranormal phenomena for generations, and has served as Mio Kurosuzu's mentor since discovering her. Kuiru is an elusive figure—very few have met him in person, and he is rarely seen in the office. It is said that this is because he has oft been the target of curses, however some theorize that it is in fact because Kuiru is not actually of flesh-and-blood at all. His seat in his office is usually occupied by a nue, a legendary creature found in Japanese folklore. The nue resembles an ordinary White's thrush and acts as Kuiru's messenger, leading to bizarre scenes of police officers earnestly reporting their findings to a bird.[r]The term "Nakagoshi case" serves as a code name used to refer to cases under investigation by Paranormal Affairs.
DOC41_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Azure Heron Agency
DOC41_ST_0002,[c4]Richter Kai's[c0] private investigation firm in Kamata, Ota City.[r]Originally, Kai thought to give it a simple name like Kai's Detective Agency, but upon hearing that people are more likely to pick names listed at the front of the phone book alphabetically, he decided to pick a name starting with an A. Thus, the Azure Heron Agency was established.[r]However, it is questionable whether the heron, a bird of somewhat ominous significance, is an effective symbol for attracting customers. Even his own assistant has referred to the name as "confusing at best." After all, rather than an azure heron, Richter keeps a white parrot as a pet and dresses not in blue, but mostly in white. If there was a symbolic connection to be made here, it has surely been lost on all but Richter himself.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]A private investigator, also known as a private eye, is a detective who operates their own agency. Although there are no formal qualifications necessary to become a private investigator, many are retired police agents or detectives due to the similarities between the work involved.[r]At a glance, private investigation firms and inquiry offices might look similar, but they carry out different types of investigations. Inquiry offices specialize in conducting credit checks on businesses, while private investigators are generally involved in tailing persons of interest and gaining information surreptitiously.

DOC42_ST_0002,An officially appointed government position with the Bureau of Onmyo in medieval Japan.[r]Onmyoji were tasked with performing divinations and rituals. They would employ the Chinese philosophies of Yin and Yang and Wuxing (the five elements) to compose astronomical charts and almanacs.[r]High-ranking practitioners used a variety of mystical arts, including ones that brought natural disasters and curses.[r]Onmyoji were also tasked with exorcising demons through the usage of shikigami.
DOC42_ST_0003,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Onmyoji thrived during the Heian period, in part due to the work of the famous onmyoji and later founder of the Tsuchimikado Clan, Abe no Seimei. However, onmyoji began to gradually decline in number after samurai gained control of Japan. At the same time, many of their miraculous arts were lost along with the development of civilization.[r]Although the services of onmyoji were typically reserved for the upper class, there were a number of "shomonji" or "hidden onmyoji" who worked for the common folk.

DOC43_ST_0002,The midpoint of the Showa era saw a marked increase in delinquency among young people.[r]A wave of violent incidents—targeting teachers as well as students, and often involving weapons—consumed the nation's middle and high schools. "Bosozoku" motorcycle gangs also enjoyed their heyday around this time.[r]Japanese arrest rates reached a historical peak during this period, and pompadoured "yankees" and female "sukeban" delinquents became a common sight on the streets.[r]This youth rebellion is often framed as a reaction to universal education policy or the pressure of highly competitive entrance exams, but its causes are likely manifold, extending far beyond the deficiencies of the education system.

DOC46_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]The Nejima Murders (Overview)
DOC46_ST_0002,A notorious case from over two decades ago involving the murder of a female high school student.[r]It first came to the attention of the authorities when part of a human left hand was discovered floating in the Sumida River. Testing revealed it to belong to a missing female high school student. As it appeared to have been severed deliberately, the police launched a murder investigation.[r]A large-scale search of the river was organized, but the highly polluted state of the water made this impossible: visibility was poor, the stench was intense, and the divers quickly fell ill. They succeeded in recovering only the victim's head and what appeared to be part of her leg before the search was called off.[r]At the time of the incident, the Sumida River was as polluted as it had ever been; neither fish nor shellfish could survive in it, eventually causing the annual fireworks festival to be called off indefinitely.[r]Over the course of the search, the police discovered a number of unidentified human bones. This caused a stir among the public, as several other young women had gone missing in recent years in the Tokyo area, and it was feared that they may have fallen victim to the same fate. Forensic technologies at the time, however, were not advanced enough to determine the identities of the deceased, and so the police were unable to open any inquiries.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Due to the overwhelming lack of circumstantial evidence, the investigation ground to a halt until a hitherto unrelated individual came to its attention. During a questioning about a separate incident, Fumichika Nejima, a thirty-six-year-old shop owner with no relation to the victim, divulged details about her that had never been released to the general public. An investigation into his background was conducted, leading to his arrest.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Nejima testified that he had snatched his victim from the street and confined her in the underground storeroom of his shop, which also served as his living quarters. He chose her for no special reason, but simply decided she was an opportune target on seeing her walking alone at night.[r]After keeping her locked up for several days, he restrained her, sewed her mouth shut, and severed her fingers and toes with a box cutter while she was still conscious. As she screamed silently behind her sealed lips, he proceeded to her wrists, her ankles, her elbows, her knees, working his way inwards slowly and methodically. His victim constantly wavered in and out of consciousness. Her ordeal continued until she died of blood loss.[r]Nejima dismembered the rest of her body and disposed of it behind his home in the Sumida River before cleaning his storeroom and returning to his everyday routine as if nothing had happened.[r]The brutality of his actions shocked the nation when they were eventually reported.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Once apprehended, Nejima readily divulged the details of the murder, but was less willing to explain his motive. When asked, he would only break down in tears, saying, "I don't know what came over me. I know it was wrong." In the end, the police could extract nothing more from him than expressions of remorse. Although the efficiency of his methods strongly suggested that he had committed similar crimes in the past, no corroborating evidence ever came to light.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]Nejima was sentenced to life in prison at his first hearing. The sentence was imposed with no appeal from the defendant.

DOC48_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]The Record of Fates Yin Scroll
DOC48_ST_0002,It is said that [c4]Seiman Tsuchimikado[c0], author of the Record of Fates, wrote the Yin Scroll because he feared that the descendants of those involved in the Honjo Incident might become cursed and used in the collection of soul dregs for the Rite of Resurrection.[r]The existence of the Yin Scroll was indicated in a postscript added to the Record of Fates, but its whereabouts are currently unknown. It is believed to have been inherited by a descendant of Seiman.
DOC48_ST_0003,[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]The text has been preserved in the form of two talismans held by Hajime Yoshimi and Michiyo Shiraishi. It contains a full account of the Honjo Incident, and the following is written in Seiman's hand:[r][c3]I bequeath this scroll to future generations to be used in the event that calamity should arise from this grievous incident. Those who seek to forestall disaster must gather these three items in one place to cast my Rite of Cleansing and expel all rituals and curses in full:[r]My soul; that is, my curse echo.[r]My body; that is, a living continuation of my bloodline.[r]My spirit; that is, my own consciousness.[c0]
DOC49_ST_0001,[c4][x1.3]Western Black Magic
DOC49_ST_0002,While magic is often classed as a branch of mysticism, or may variously refer to the likes of witchcraft or astrology, here it refers specifically to Western black magic.[r]In the Middle Ages, the line between science and magic was blurred, with the pursuit of the supernatural considered a legitimate academic discipline. Astrology was regarded akin to astronomy, while alchemy was accepted as scientific fact and would eventually evolve into what is known today as chemistry.[r]One discipline, however, was considered wicked and shunned accordingly: black magic. The practice of using magical knowledge to strike a bargain with demons.[r][c0]　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*[c0][r]In contrast to the socially acceptable subjects studied by the intelligentsia, black magic was most prolific among the lower classes. It was the common people who suffered most from the ills of the day—war, famine, and sickness—which perhaps led them to seek aid from unholy powers.[r]As heresy, these rituals and spells were nowhere to be found in orthodox modes of teaching, but instead were recorded in tomes of dubious credibility.
